<h3><span class="smcap">To the Purchaser:</span></h3>

<p>Lying Supernaturalism is going; robbing Capitalism is
falling; saving Laborism is rising, and leveling Unionism
is coming.</p>

<p>This booklet, Communism and Christianism, is a contribution
by Bishop and Mrs. Wm. M. Brown, of Galion,
Ohio, towards the furtherance of these downward, upward
and forward movements, the most fortunate events
in the whole history of mankind. We hope that you will
read, mark, learn and inwardly digest its extremely
revolutionary, comprehensive and salutary teachings concerning
both religion and politics with the happy result
of becoming an apostle of its illuminating and inspiring
interpretation of the scientific gospel of Marx and Engels
to wage slaves, the only gospel which points the way to
redemption from their body and soul destroying slavery.</p>

<p>You may become a missionary of this gospel in your
neighborhood, and as such do more good than all its
orthodox preachers, teachers, editors and politicians together
at no financial cost to yourself by ordering booklets
at our special rates: six copies, $1.00; twenty-five
copies, $3.00, prepaid, and selling them to workers at
our retail price, 25 cents for one copy. As we make
no profit and do no bookkeeping, cash should accompany
all orders.</p>

<p>To organizations working for bail, defense, liberation
or unemployment funds, Bishop and Mrs. Brown
donate twenty-five copies for each twenty-five ordered
with remittance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Religion is the opium of the people. The
suppression of religion as the happiness of the
people is the revindication of its real happiness.
The invitation to abandon illusions regarding
its situation is an invitation to abandon
a situation which has need of illusions.
Criticism of religion is therefore the germ of
a criticism of the vale of tears, of which religion
is the holy aspect.</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;Marx.</p></div>


<p>Not only, indeed, is the struggle against religion
intellectually useful, but it cannot conscientiously be
avoided, for religion is used against the Socialist
movement by the possessing class in every country.</p>

<p>But to abolish religion is not to abolish exploitation,
because only one of the enemy's guns will have been
silenced. The workers have, above all, to dislodge
the capitalist class from power. The religious question,
and indeed all else, is secondary to this.</p>

<p>The test of admission to a Socialist Party must be
neither more nor less than acceptance of the following
seven working principles and the policy of
Socialism as a class movement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Society as at present constituted is based upon
the ownership of the means of living (i. e., land, factories,
railways, etc.) by the capitalist or master class,
and the consequent enslavement of the working class,
by whose labor alone wealth is produced.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>2. In society, therefore, there is an antagonism of
interests, manifesting itself as a class struggle, between
those who possess but do not produce and
those who produce but do not possess.</p>

<p>3. This antagonism can be abolished only by the
emancipation of the working class from the domination
of the master class by the conversion into the
common property of society of the means of production
and distribution, and their democratic control
by the whole people.</p>

<p>4. As in the order of social evolution the working
class is the last to achieve its freedom, the emancipation
of the working class will involve the emancipation of all
mankind without distinction of race or sex.</p>

<p>5. This emancipation must be the work of the
working class itself.</p>

<p>6. As the machinery of capitalist government, including
the armed forces of the nation, conserves the
monopoly by the capitalist class of the wealth taken
from the workers, the working class must organize
consciously and politically for acquiring the powers
of government, national and local, in order that this
machinery, including these forces, may be converted
from an instrument of oppression into the agent of
emancipation and the overthrow of privilege, aristocratic
and plutocratic.<a name="Btop" id="Btop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#B">[B]</a></span></p>

<p>7. As all political parties are but the expression of
class interests, and as the interest of the working class
is diametrically opposed to the interests of all sections
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>of the master-class, the party seeking working-class
emancipation must be hostile to every other party.</p></div>

<p>If a man supports the church, or in any respect
allows religious ideas to stand in the way of the foregoing
seven essential principles of socialism or the
activity of a Party, he proves thereby that he does
not accept Socialism as fundamentally true and of the
first importance, and his place is outside.</p>

<p>No man can be consistently both a Socialist and a
Christian. It must be either the socialist or the religious
principle that is supreme, for the attempt to
couple them equally betrays charlatanism or lack of
thought. There is, therefore, no need for a specifically
anti-religious test.</p>

<p>So surely does the acceptance of Socialism lead to
the exclusion of the supernatural, that the Socialist
has little need for such terms as Atheist, Free-thinker,
or even Materialist; for the word Socialist,
rightly understood, implies one who, on all such questions,
takes his stand on positive science, explaining
all things by purely natural causation, Socialism being
not merely a politico-economic creed, but also an
integral part of a consistent world philosophy.</p>

<p>So long as the anarchy of modern competitive
society exists, the accompanying obscurity and confusion
in social life will continue to shelter superstition.
This point is illustrated in the following
reference by Marx to the United States:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When we see in the very country of complete
political emancipation not only that religion exists,
but retains its vigour, there is no need, I hope, for
other proofs in order to show that the existence of religion
is not incompatible with the full political
maturity of the State. But if religion exists it is be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>cause
of a defective social organization, of which it is
necessary to seek the cause in the very essence of the
State.</p></div>

<p>Class domination is the essence of the modern
State. It is based on competitive anarchy and
parasitism&mdash;the evidences of a defective social organization.
It still leaves room for religion, because it
maintains ignorance and confusion by its structure
and contradictions, and because religion is fostered as
a handmaiden of class rule.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the growth of the social forces of production
within modern society, and the better knowledge
the workers obtain of their true relations to each
other and to Nature, loosen the chains of ghost worship
and mysticism from their limbs and lessen the
power of religion as a political weapon in the hands
of the ruling class, while they form, at the same time,
the material and intellectual preparation for an intelligently
organized society. The matter has been
put in a nutshell by Marx in the chapter on "Commodities"
in "Capital," volume I.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The religious reflex of the real world can, in any
case, only then finally vanish, when the practical relations
of every-day life offer to man none but perfectly
intelligible and reasonable relations with regard
to his fellow men and to nature.</p>

<p>The life process of society, which is based on the
process of material production, does not strip off its
mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely
associated men, and is consciously regulated by them
in accordance with a settled plan.</p>

<p>This, however, demands for society a certain
material groundwork or set of conditions of existence
which in their turn are the spontaneous product of a
long and painful process of development.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, therefore, a profound truth that Socialism is
the natural enemy of religion. Through Socialism
alone will the relations between men in society, and
their relations to Nature, become reasonable, orderly,
and completely intelligible, leaving no nook or cranny
for superstition. The entry of Socialism is, consequently,
the exodus of religion.</p>

Socialists throughout the world want a peaceful evolution

be so in the case of any country is, as Lenin prophesies,
to be determined by the dealings of its capitalists with
its laborers. In reply to an inquiry on this vexed subject
by an English author, Lenin said, in effect, that in England,
as elsewhere, the tactics of the capitalist class will determine
the program of the labor class.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hitherto, every form of society has been based on
the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes.
But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions
must be assured to it under which it can, at least,
continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period
of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune,
just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of
feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a
bourgeois. The modern laborer, on the contrary, instead
of rising with the progress of industry, sinks
deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence
of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and
pauperism develops more rapidly than population and
wealth. And here it becomes evident that the
bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class
in society, and to impose its conditions of existence
upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to
rule, because it is incompetent to assure an existence
to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help
letting him sink into such a state that it has to feed
him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no
longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its
existence is no longer compatible with society.&mdash;Marx
and Engels.</p></div>

<p>The concept of God, as an explanation of the Universe,
is becoming entirely untenable in this age of
scientific inquiry. The laws of the persistence of
force and the indestructibility of matter, and the unending
interplay of cause and effect, make the attempt
to trace the origin of things to an anthropomorphic
God who had no cause, as futile as is the
Oriental cosmology which holds that the world rests
on an elephant, and, as an afterthought, that the
elephant stands on a tortoise.</p>

<p>The inflexible laws of the known universe cannot
logically be held to cease where our immediate experience
ends, to make way for an unscientific concept
of an uncaused and creating being. The Creation
idea is unsupported by evidence, and is in conflict with
every scientific law.</p>

<p>Socialism is consistent only with that monistic view
which regards all phenomena as expressions of the
underlying matter-force reality and as parts of the
unity of Nature which interact according to inviolable
laws.</p>

<p>Socialism is the application of science, the archenemy
of religion, to human social relationships; and
just as the basic principle of the philosophy of Socialism
finds itself in conflict with religion, so does it,
as a propagandist movement, find religion acting
against it.</p>

<h2>COMMUNISM: THE NATURALISTIC THIS-WORLDLY
GOSPEL FOR THE COMING
AGE OF CLASSLESS EQUALITY
AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM.</h2>

<h4>Make the World safe for Industrialism<br />
by turning it upside down with<br />
Workers above and Owners below.</h4>


<p>My dear Brother and Comrade:</p>

<p>Your letter of June 13th<a name="Dtop" id="Dtop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#D">[D]</a></span> relative to the meeting
called for the 27th, in the interest of a more radical
socialist movement in our church, came duly to hand,
and its invitation to attend, or at least write, was
highly appreciated.</p>

<p>My days for attending things are, I fear, past. I
did not feel able to go to the Annual Convention of
the Socialist Party of Ohio, which met much nearer
here on the same date, June 27th, and ended on the
29th with a great picnic&mdash;a communion, as real and
holy, as was ever celebrated. I cannot even be sure
of being with you in the House of Bishops during
the meeting of the General Convention in October.</p>

<p>However, I intended you to have a letter and set
the 26th aside for the writing of it, but I work slowly
now and its hours slipped away while I was making
notes until only one was left. It was spent in trying
to condense all I wanted to say in the letter into a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>telegram. What I regard as the best of these efforts
was taken to the office at seven p. m. on that day:</p>

<p>Make world safe for democracy by banishing Gods
from sky, and capitalists from earth.</p>

<p>Here are four of the many other efforts: (1) Come
over and help us. Abandon Christian Socialism for
Marxian Communism; (2) Make world safe for
democracy by turning it upside down with workers
above and owners below; (3) Revolutionize capitalism
out of state and orthodoxy out of church; (4) Come
over and help us. Abandon reformatory for revolutionary
socialism.</p>

<p>What I wanted you to understand is that, in my
judgment, there can be no deliverance for the world
from the troubles by which it is overwhelmed so long
as theism holds the religious field and capitalism the
political field.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>Religion and politics are the two halves of the
sphere in which humanity lives, moves and has its
social being. Religion is the ideal and politics the
practical half of this sphere. Both halves naturally
exist as the result of the same natural law of necessity:
the matter-force law which makes it necessary
for a man to feed, clothe and shelter his body in order
to preserve it and its life.</p>

<p>Marxian socialism is at once this religion and politics,
all there is of both of them which is for the good
of the world as a whole.</p>

<p>Marxian socialism is a revolutionary movement
towards doing away with the existing competitive
system for producing and distributing the basic necessities
of life (foods, clothes and houses) for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
profit of a few parasites, and substituting a system for
making and distributing them for the use of all workers.</p>

<p>So far some competing, lying, robbing, enslaving
system for the production and distribution of these
necessities has been the basis of every religion and
politics&mdash;of none more than the Christian and American,
and they with the rest have been tried in the
balance of experience and found utterly wanting. Indeed,
they are making a hell, not a heaven, of the
earth in general and of our country in particular.</p>

<p>Christianism as a religion has collapsed. It promised
to secure to the world peace and good will, but
it has never had more of strife and hate. The tremendous
English-German (or if you prefer German-English)
war was a conflict at arms between the most
outstanding among Christian nations and it was solemnly
alleged to have been fought for the high purpose
of ending such conflicts; but in reality it scattered
the hot coals of war throughout the world,
several of which were fanned into blazing by its so-called
peace conference and others are ominously
smouldering.</p>

<p>Americanism as a politics has collapsed. It promised
a classless government of all the people, by all
the people, for all the people, but has instead given a
government of a class, by a class, for a class. This
class, comprising not more than one out of every ten
of the population, is the capitalist class, which owns the
means and machines for the production of the necessities
of life and for their distribution, a class which,
as such, though bearing no necessary relationship
to either one of the branches of this business, yet
realizes enormous profits from both, profits which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
are wholly at the expense of the large class, at least
nine out of every ten, which does all the work connected
with the making of the machines and the operating
of them.</p>

<p>This government was to make the country safe for
democracy by securing to it the privilege of free
speech and free assemblage, the existence of an independent
press and the right of appeal for the redress
of grievances; but our fathers did not have any too
much of these liberties, we have had less and, if the
competitive system for the production and distribution
of commodities for the profit of the small owning
class is to continue, our children are to have none.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is already true of the overwhelming
majority, the working class. Its representatives have
little if any real part in the government. They are
completely subjected to the rule of the owning class.
There never has been a body, mind and soul destroying
slavery which equaled theirs, either as to the number
of men, women and children involved in it, or as
to the degrees of misery to which it doomed its victims.</p>

<p>Nor is the end yet. The world war certainly has
taken American slavery out of the frying pan into the
fire rather than into the water.</p>

<p>American slaves appeal to their government as
Jewish slaves appealed to one of their kings for relief
and receive the same answer, not in words but in
deeds which speak louder:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore
make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his
heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will
serve thee. And he said unto them, Depart yet for
three days, then come again to me. And the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
departed. So all the people came the third day as the
king had appointed and the king answered them
roughly, saying: My father made your yoke heavy,
and I will add to your yoke: My father also chastised
you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
So when all Israel saw that the king harkened not
unto them, the people answered the king, saying,
What portion have we in David?</p></div>

<p>As to details history does not exactly repeat itself
and, therefore, I do not believe that the other planets
of the universe, of which no doubt there are
many billions, are inhabited by human beings of the
same type as those of the earth, nor that its men,
women and children are to have their bodies reconstructed
and resurrected, after they have been disintegrated
by death. Such beings on other planets and
such reconstructions on this planet would in every
case involve a detailed repetition of infinitely numerous
processes of evolution which had extended
through an eternal past.</p>

<p>Yet in every part of the universe and throughout
all eternity, like causes ever have produced and ever
shall produce like effect. If, therefore, the course of
the Judean masters towards their slaves led to a successful
revolt of ten out of twelve tribes, there is
every reason for believing that the parallel course
which the American masters are pursuing against
their slaves will sooner or later issue in a revolution&mdash;a
revolution which shall do away with both
masters and slaves, leaving us with a classless America
and a government concerned with the making of
provisions for enabling all the people who are able
and willing to work to supply themselves in abundance
with the necessities of life and with the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
desirable among the luxuries, rather than a government
which provides that they who produce nothing
shall have the cream and top milk of every necessity
and the whole bottle of every luxury, leaving of the
necessities only the blue milk for the producers of
them and of the luxuries, not even the dregs.</p>

<p>Under this government those who can but will not
work will be allowed to starve themselves into a better
mind and out of their laziness. The young and the
old, the sick and crippled will have their rightful
maintenance from the state and out of the best of
everything.</p>

<p>The deliverance of the world from commercial imperialism
and the making of it safe for industrial
democracy would prevent most of its unnecessary
suffering and this great salvation is above all else
dependent upon a knowledge of the truth. "Ye shall
know the truth and the truth shall make you free"&mdash;free
from all the avoidable ills of life, among them the
diabolical trinity of evils, war, poverty and slavery.</p>

<p>The happiness of the world will be promoted in
extent and degree in proportion as the knowledge of
the truth is disseminated by a twofold revelation:
(1) the truth as it is revealed by history according to
the Marxian interpretation thereof, a revelation of the
truth which is saving the world from the robbing impositions
of the capitalistic interpretation of politics,
and (2) the truth as it is revealed by nature, according
to the Darwinian interpretation thereof, a revelation
which is saving the world from the robbing impositions
of the supernaturalistic interpretations of religion.</p>

<p>Man has always had as a basis for his thought,
belief and action, a system for the production and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
distribution of the necessities of life. This is the discovery
of Karl Marx which is known as the scientific
or materialistic interpretation of history.</p>

<p>According to the scientific interpretation of history
which is taught by naturalistic socialism, man is what
he is, and his institutions are what they are, because
he has fed, clothed and housed himself as he has.</p>

<p>According to the traditional interpretation of history,
which is taught by supernaturalistic Christianism,
man is what he is because of his thinking, believing
and acting with reference to a revelation of a god,
as it has been interpreted by his inspired representatives,
the great prophets and statesmen, like Isaiah
and Luther, Moses and Washington.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best proof of the correctness of the
scientific or naturalistic explanation of the career of
man and of the incorrectness of the traditional or supernaturalistic
one is afforded by the history of morals,
the soul of both religion and politics, without
which neither could have any existence.</p>

<p>Before the discovery of the art of agriculture, man
was dependent for his food upon fruits and nuts,
game and fish. When these sources of sustenance
failed, the tribes living in the same neighborhood
fought with each other in order that the victorious
might eat the vanquished.</p>

<p>During this period cannibalism was morally right,
and it probably extended through at least two hundred
thousand years, even into the Old Testament
times. So righteous and holy was it that, in the
course of time, the victims were recognized as saviour
gods and the drinking of their blood and eating of their
flesh constituted a Lord's Supper in which the god
was eaten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Cannibalism is the basis of our sacrament of the
holy communion of bread and wine. As a connecting
link between these extremes there was the form of
communion which consisted in the eating of animal
sacrifices.</p>

<p>By a sacrament with such an origin, you and I render
our highest act of worship, though yours is still
directed towards one among the supernaturalistic
divinities and mine is now directed towards humanity.
You say of a divinity: Thou, Lord, hast made me after
thine own image and my heart cannot be at rest until
I find rest in thee. I say of humanity: Thou, Lord,
hast made me after thine own image and my heart
cannot be at rest until it find rest in thee.</p>

<p>Within the social realm humanity is my new divinity,
and your divinity (my old one) is a symbol of it,
or else, so I think, he is at best a fiction and at worst
a superstition.</p>

<p>You will be surprised, and I do not expect you to
understand me, when I tell you that by translating
the services and hymns from the language of my old
literalism into that of my new symbolism, I am getting
as much good out of them as ever and indeed
more. I love the services, especially that great one,
the Holy Communion, and the hymns, especially those
great ones, Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah; Lead,
Kindly Light; Abide With Me; and Jesus, Lover of
My Soul.</p>

<p>My experience has convinced me that the sentimental
and poetical elements in religion, to which I
attach as much importance as ever, are as readily
excited and securely sustained by fixing thought and
sympathy upon the martyred human savior, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
working class, as upon a crucified divine saviour,
who after all, as the suffering son of God, is but a symbol
of the suffering sons and daughters of man, the
workers, from whom all good things come.</p>

<p>If grace at dinner means anything, it is addressed to
a god who is the symbol of the many workers who did
the innumerable things necessary to the producing and
serving of it, without whom there would be nothing of
all the good things on the table.</p>

<p>In the representation about my pleasure in the
services of the church and their value to me, and in
many representations scattered throughout this letter,
I have in mind the question of an unanswered
letter of yours, bearing date, February 25th, 1919, the
one in which you ask, in effect, by what right a man
can remain in an institution after he has, as I have,
abandoned its chief doctrines and aims as they are
authoritatively interpreted.</p>

<p>The right of revolution is the one by which I justify
my course, and surely no consistent Protestant Christian
or American citizen will doubt the solidity of this
ground; for Protestantism and Americanism had their
origin in revolutions.</p>

<p>Our national declaration of independence contains
this famous justification of political revolutions, and
it is equally applicable to religious ones, for religion
and politics are but the ideal and practical halves of
the same social reality:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal; that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among
these, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
That to secure these rights, governments are insti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>tuted
among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed: that, whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to
institute a new government, laying its foundation on
such principles, and organizing its powers in such
form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments long established, should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly,
all experience hath shown, that mankind are
more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed. But, when a long train
of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same object, evinces a design to reduce them under
absolute despotism, it is their right&mdash;and it is their
duty&mdash;to throw off such government, and to provide
new guards for their security.</p></div>

<p>Jesus was nothing if he was not a revolutionist.
Anyhow, his alleged mother is authoritatively represented
as believing him to have been foreordained as
one, for this song is put into her mouth:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He hath showed strength with his arm: he hath
scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>

<p>He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and
hath exalted the humble and meek.</p>

<p>He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the
rich he hath sent empty away.</p></div>

<p>This Christian socialism, like Bolshevik socialism,
turns the idle rich empty away; but, whereas the
Christian gives them no chance to get anything to eat,
the Bolshevik allows them to have as much as the
poor, if they will work as hard.</p>

<p>Assuming for the sake of argument, that there may
have been an historical Jesus who taught some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
doctrines, in accordance with the representations of
the gospel, which are attributed to him, I am nevertheless
justified in claiming that he was quite as
heretical touching the faith of orthodox Judaism as I
am touching that of orthodox Christianism.</p>

<p>As to the Jewish faith he said, in effect, of himself
what I say of myself: I have all of the potentialities
of my own life within myself. I and my god are one.
He dwells in me and I in him, and we are on the earth,
not in the sky.</p>

<p>As to the Jewish church and state, Jesus taught
that they had become utterly antiquated and that it
was the mission of himself and disciples to establish
a new heaven, that is to remodel the church; and a
new earth, that is, to remodel the state; both remodelings
being with reference to the service of humanity
by enlightening its darkness and alleviating its misery
here and now, rather than teaching it to look for light
and happiness elsewhere and elsewhen.<a name="Etop" id="Etop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#E">[E]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the faith and church of orthodox Christianism
there is no reason for believing that he would be
any more loyal to either than am I. His loyalty was
to the truth and to the proletarian, and they (this
faith and church) are disloyal to both, being ever on
the side of tradition against science, and on the side
of the owner against the worker.</p>

<p>Jesus remained in the Jewish church, in spite of his
many and great heresies, until he was put out by death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>My contention is that in view of this example, whether it
be, as you think, of an historical or, as I think, of a
dramatic character, there is no reason why I should
voluntarily go out of the Christian church.</p>

<p>Religion in general and Christianity in particular
are nothing unless they are embodiments of morality,
and morality does not consist in professions of belief
in a god and his revelations as they are recorded in a
bible and condensed in a creed, but in a desire and
effort to acquire a knowledge of the laws of nature in
order that, by conformity to them, life may be made
longer and happier.</p>

<p>When this desire exists and this effort is made
with reference to one's own self, they constitute morality;
when with reference to one's own family and
associates, they constitute religion, and when with
reference to all others of contemporary and future
generations, they constitute Christianity.</p>

<p>But in making such distinctions the fact should not
be lost sight of that at bottom there is no difference
between morality, religion and Christianity. They are
synonyms for the same virtues, the desire and effort
to know and live the truth as it is revealed in the doings
of nature. There are no other revelations of
the truth, nor is there any other morality, religion or
Christianity.</p>

<p>Socialism is for me the one comprehensive term
which is a synonym at once of morality, religion and
Christianity. Marxian and Bolshevikian socialism are
two halves of one thing, the theoretical half and the
practical half. Marxism is socialism in theory. Bolshevism
is (perhaps imperfectly as yet) socialism
in practice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>As long as gods dominate the sky and capitalists
prevail upon the earth, the world will be safe for commercial
imperialism, having a small heaven for the few
rich masters and a large hell for the many poor slaves.</p>

<p>Come over and help us make the world safe for
industrial democracy by banishing the personal, conscious
gods from the sky and the lying, robbing capitalists
from the earth.</p>

<p>But in coming there is no need for leaving your
church any more than there is for leaving your state.
During the short time which is for me, before the
night cometh in which no man can work, I shall remain
in both as long as the powers that be allow it,
and do what little I can to revolutionize them&mdash;revolutionize
the church into a school for the teaching of
truth instead of lies, and revolutionize the state into a
hive for the making of commodities for the use of all
instead of for the profit of a few. In doing this I shall
be following in the very footsteps of the human Jesus.</p>

<p>After it was discovered that the ground, by planting
and cultivating, would produce the necessities of
life, when a tribe found that it had too little of it for
its growing population, it would go to war with the
weaker among adjacent tribes for the purpose of securing
its territory; but from this on the vanquished
were not eaten, and it was morally wrong to eat them.
They were kept alive and put to work at raising
harvests for their conquerors, hence arose the institution
of slavery, and hence its moral rightness even
in this country of the free, down to the beginning of
the generation to which I belong.</p>

<p>However, human slavery has never ended, nor will
it ever end while the competitive system for the pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>duction
of the necessities of life for profit rather than
use continues. Human slavery is, so to speak, the
basic ingredient of this system.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, there have been three forms of
human slavery&mdash;the chattel, feudal and wage slaveries&mdash;the
third much worse than the first, and the second
intermediary between them.</p>

<p>The chattel slave, as the adjective signifies, was the
property of his master, as much so as were the horse
or the mule with which he worked, and he was cared
for in much the same way and for about the same reason.</p>

<p>The feudal slave was as really a chattel as was his
predecessor, only he had to look out for himself to a
greater extent; and, more was expected from him of
accomplishment for the opulence and glory of the master,
especially insofar as these depended upon the success
of his wars.</p>

<p>The wage slave is, likewise, as really owned by his
master as was the chattel or the feudal slave; but, if
the master has no need for his service, he is altogether
down and out, as the feudal slave was not and still
less the chattel, and he has accomplished at least ten
times more for his master than did either of his predecessors.</p>

<p>So far man has produced and distributed the necessities
of life by a competitive system. The existing
form of this competition is known as capitalism. It
has supplanted, or at least overshadowed, every other
form and is, so to speak, monarch of all it surveys.</p>

<p>The system as it now stands divides the world into
two spheres&mdash;a small one, in which a few live surfeitingly
by owning, and a large one, in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
many live starvingly by working; and, yet, ultimately,
absolutely everything for both depends upon the worker
and nothing at all on the owner.</p>

<p>Yes, the worker is indispensable to the owner, as much
so as (to use the classical illustration) the dog
to the flea; but the owner is no more indispensable to
the worker than a flea to a dog. As dogs would be
much better off without fleas, so would workers without
owners.</p>

<p>The discovery that the itch is caused by a parasite
was of an epoch making character because it led to
the discovery that many, if not most of the diseases
by which mankind and also animal kind are afflicted
are of a parasitical character. This is as true of the
social organism as of the physical. Capitalism is the
tape worm of society.</p>

<p>The existence of the master and slave classes inevitably
gives rise to four struggles: (1) the struggle
of the slaves with the master for better conditions,
issuing in rebellions; (2) the struggle between masters
for advantages in markets, issuing in wars; (3) the
struggle between the slaves for jobs, issuing in a body
and soul destroying poverty; and (4) the struggle of
the slaves with the master for a reversal of conditions,
issuing in revolutions.</p>

<p>All this struggling between the classes and within
them tends towards two results with both classes.</p>

<p>In the case of the master class, these results are the
making of the rich fewer and the remaining few
richer.</p>

<p>In the case of the slave class, these results are the
making of the miserable poor more numerous and all
less happy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>While capitalism stands, all talk about peace on
earth and good will among men will be so much hypocrisy;
for, until it falls, the world will be divided
into the slave and master classes and these four contentions
with these results will continue to fill it with
hatred and strife.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The overthrow of capitalism in Russia is the greatest
event in the history of the world and it has converted
International Socialism (the Marxian revolutionary
kind) from a theory into a condition.</p>

<p>Theories come and go. Conditions remain and
work. From this on revolutionary socialism will be
working, night and day, with might and main, here
and there, everywhen and everywhere, and its three
herculean tasks are: (1) to dethrone the great imperialist,
competitive capitalism; (2) to enthrone the
great democrat, co-operative industrialism; and (3)
to make the world safe for an industrial classless democracy.</p>

<p>In less than three years revolutionary socialism in
Russia has accomplished more of these three tasks for
the world, than all the states and all the churches with
all their wars have done in the whole course of man's
career, extending through at least two hundred thousand
years. Indeed they never did anything to these
ends. On the contrary, what progress has been made
towards them was made in spite of their strenuous
opposition at every step.</p>

<p>Revolutionary socialism is a world movement towards
the deliverance of the producing slave from the
non-producing master who has robbed him of the
fruits of his toil and left him half dead on the wayside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>&mdash;the
only effective movement to this humanitarian
end.</p>

<p>Revolutionary socialism is the Good Samaritan of
the despoiled and wounded laborer. The reformatory
kinds of socialism are so many priests and Levites who
pass by on the other side.</p>

<p>Of no reformatory socialism is this more true than
of the Christian kind. Christian socialism is absolutely
worthless, and its utter worthlessness is due to
the essentially parasitic character of supernaturalistic
or orthodox Christianity.</p>

<p>Until the reformation, Christianity was dominated
by monks&mdash;parasites who lived by begging, lying, and
persecuting; and since then by capitalists&mdash;parasites
who live by robbing, lying and warring.</p>

<p>Monks and capitalists have this in common, that
they are natives of the realm of parasitism.</p>

<p>We shall never have peace on earth and good will
among men until we have a parasiteless humanity,
and we must wait for this until we have a classless
world. Parasitism is a boon companion of classism.</p>

<p>Nor can the earth ever be rid of its parasites until
the celestial world is rid of the class gods which capitalists
have made in their own image and likeness, nor
until the terrestrial world is rid of the class states and
codes, churches and gospels which their respective
class kings or presidents and their class priests or
preachers have had the gods of their making impose
upon this world, in accordance with their interests
and in the furtherance of their lying, robbing, warring
schemes for the promotion of them.</p>

<p>Neither capitalism nor Christianism is anything except
insofar as it is a system of parasitism and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
parasitic systems they have striking resemblances,
nearly as many and close as indistinguishable twins.</p>

<p>Both have gods, churches and priesthoods and these
are in each case nothing but symbols.</p>

<p>However, the god of capitalism, though only a symbol,
is nevertheless real gold, below a real vault, and
nearly all the world sincerely worships it.</p>

<p>But the god of Christianism, though none the less
symbolic, but rather more so, is an unreal imaginary
spirit, a magnified man without a body, above an
imaginary vault, and only a very small part of the
world sincerely worships him.</p>

<p>International socialism of the Marxian or Russian
type, is for those who starvingly live by working, the
most uplifting thing in the world, and for those who
surfeitingly live by owning, it is the most depressing
thing in the world.</p>

<p>Wise people consider theories without losing too
much, if any, sleep on their account, but they study
conditions and lie awake nights over them.</p>

<p>Millions of wise Americans have, in the past, been
studying socialism as a theory but, in the future, they
will study it as a condition, in the only way by which
it can rightly and adequately be studied&mdash;the way of
reading its official documents, accredited periodicals
and books. Of all such, the most notable is the
Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels.</p>

<p>This Manifesto is the Marxian gospel. I read two
pages in it every day as faithfully as ever I read a
chapter in the Jesuine gospel, and with much greater
profit; for, whereas the gospel of Marx is exclusively
concerned with this terrestrial world, about which I
know much and for which I can do a little, the gospel
of Jesus is as exclusively concerned with a celestial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
world, about which I know nothing and for which I
cannot do the least. Here, as a sample of this gospel,
I give half of yesterday's reading and most of today's:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The immediate aim of the Communists (Socialists)
is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties;
formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of
the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power
by the proletariat.</p>

<p>The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are
in no way based on ideas or principles that have been
invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal
reformer.</p>

<p>They merely express, in general terms, actual relations
springing from an existing class struggle, from
a historical movement going on under our very eyes.
The abolition of existing property relations is not at
all a distinctive feature of Communism.</p>

<p>All property relations in the past have continually
been subject to historical change consequent upon the
change in historical conditions.</p>

<p>The French Revolution, for example, abolished
feudal property in favor of bourgeois property.</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of Communism is not
the abolition of property generally, but the abolition
of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private
property is the final and most complete expression of
the system of producing and appropriating products,
that is based on class antagonism, on the exploitation
of the many by the few.</p>

<p>In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be
summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of
private property.</p>

<p>We Communists have been reproached with the desire
of abolishing the right of personally acquiring
property as the fruit of a man's own labor, which
property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal
freedom, activity and independence.</p>

<p>Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
you mean the property of the petty artisan and of the
small peasant, a form of property that preceded the
bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that;
the development of industry has, to a great extent,
already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.</p>

<p>Or do you mean modern bourgeois private property?</p>

<p>But does wage-labor create any property for the
laborer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i. e., that kind
of property which exploits wage-labor, and which cannot
increase except upon condition of getting a new
supply of wage-labor for fresh exploitation. Property,
in its present form, is based on the antagonism of
capital and wage-labor. Let us examine both sides
of this antagonism.</p>

<p>To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal,
but a social status in production. Capital is a
collective product, and only by the united action of
many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the
united action of all members of society, can it be set
in motion.</p>

<p>Capital is therefore not a personal, it is a social
power.</p>

<p>When, therefore, capital is converted into common
property, into the property of all members of society,
personal property is not thereby transformed into
social property. It is only the social character of the
property that is changed. It loses its class-character.</p>

<p>Let us now take wage-labor:</p>

<p>The average price of wage-labor is the minimum
wage, i. e., that quantum of the means of subsistence,
which is absolutely requisite to keep the laborer in
bare existence, as his labor merely suffices to prolong
and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend
to abolish this personal appropriation of the
products of labor, an appropriation that is made for
the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and
that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the
labor of others. All that we want to do away with
is the miserable character of this appropriation, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
which the laborer lives merely to increase capital, and
is allowed to live only insofar as the interest of the
ruling class requires it.</p>

<p>In bourgeois society, living labor is but a means to
increase accumulated labor. In Communist society,
accumulated labor is but a means to widen, to enrich,
to promote the existence of the laborer.</p>

<p>In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates
the present; in Communist society, the present dominates
the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent
and has individuality, while the living person
is dependent and has no individuality.</p>

<p>And the abolition of this state of things is called by
the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom!
And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality,
bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom
is undoubtedly aimed at.</p></div>

<p>The version of the Marxian gospel which we have
in the Manifesto is among the first of its versions. It
was published about the middle of the last century.
Within the short period which has intervened, it has
changed nearly all of the ideas of a large and rapidly
growing part of every nation about almost everything
social; and before the middle of the present century,
it will revolutionize all nations as it has Russia.</p>

<p>Ludendorff, the greatest among the military authorities
in Germany, saw and terribly feared this, and
called Europe to arms to prevent it. In his almost
frantic appeal he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bolshevism is advancing now and in a gradual
progress from east to west and is crushing everything
between the midland sea and the Atlantic ocean. It
was easy to foresee that the Bolshevist armies would
attack toward the middle of May and defeat the Poles,
as they have now done. The world at large must,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
therefore, figure with a Bolshevist advance in Poland
toward Berlin and Prague.</p>

<p>Poland's fall will entail the fall of Germany and
Czecho-Slovakia. Their neighbors to the north and
south will follow. Fate steps along with elementary
force. Let no one believe it will come to a stand
without enveloping Italy, France and England. Not
even the Seven Seas can stop it.</p></div>

<p>Under the capitalist system most people are and
must continue to be slaves. If you are a slave (all
wage earners, as such, are slaves) the socialist literature,
the greatest of all literatures, will thrill you with
the hope of liberty. Read, note and inwardly digest it.
No wage earner who does this will ever again vote
either the Democratic or the Republican ticket. As a
whole this literature is a brilliantly illuminating and
almost resistlessly persuasive explanation of the most
sane, the most salutary and withal the most promising
movement towards the freeing of all toiling men, women
and children (nine of every ten) from their body and
soul destroying slavery.</p>

<p>Both Socrates and Jesus are recorded as teaching
that the saviour of the world is truth. Among saving
truths (there is no truth without some saving efficacy)
the greatest is the one which was discovered
and formulated concurrently by Karl Marx and Frederick
Engels and it is in substance this: all which
makes for the good of mankind ultimately depends
wholly upon the laborious constructors and operators
of the machines for the cultivation, production and
distribution of the necessities of life, not at all upon
the owners of these machines, who at best are idlers
and at worst schemers, and in any case parasites.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>In the beginning was Work. All things were made
by it; and without it was not anything made that was
made. In it was life; and the life was the light of
men.</p></div>

<p>The opening verses of the gospel according to John
have been thus interpreted. The commentator acknowledges
that they do not read so now, but contends for
good and sufficient reasons, that, if there ever was any
truth in them, something to this effect must have been
their original reading. Certainly there is no truth in
them as they have come down to us.</p>

<p>This representation to the effect that productive
labor is the saviour of the world, its real god, the
divinity in which we live, move and have our being, is
the great truth, the gospel of International Socialism,
the greatest of all movements, the movement which
carries the only rational hope for the freeing of mankind
from all its unnecessary suffering&mdash;and the most
poignant sufferings, those imposed by the great trinity
of evils: (war, poverty and slavery) are not necessary.</p>

<p>Capitalism and Christianism are alike not only in
having gods which are symbols, but also in having
great buildings set apart for the worshipping of them.</p>

<p>The representatives of the god below the vault worship
him in banks under the leadership of a threefold
ministry: presidents, cashiers and bookkeepers.</p>

<p>The representatives of the god above the vault worship
him in churches under the leadership of a threefold
ministry: bishops, priests and deacons.</p>

<p>Speaking particularly of Christianity and America
the trouble is not at all with our Brother Jesus and
Uncle Sam divinities, but wholly with what they symbolize,
capitalism&mdash;the god of liars, robbers and warriors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>What our Brother Jesus and Uncle Sam should
alike symbolize are the classless divinities: (1) law,
the king of the physical realm, and (2) truth, the
queen of the moral realm.</p>

<p>Law is what nature does. There is no other law,
and this law is the god of the physical realm. The gods
of the supernaturalistic interpretations of religion
(Jesus, Jehovah, Allah, Buddha, and all the rest) are
personifications, or symbols, of this god, or else they
are superstitions.</p>

<p>This representation is proved in practice to be true,
on the one hand, by the fact that no one needs to live
with reference to any among those gods, not even the
god, Jesus; and, on the other hand, by the fact that
none who fail to live with reference to this god, law,
lives at all.</p>

<p>Every act of nature, that is, every physical and psychical
phenomenon which enters into the constitution
of the universe, is a word of the revelation of this god,
and there is no other revelation. All men must constantly
live with reference to it or else immediately
die.</p>

<p>Truth is the interpretation of this law in the light
of human experience, reason and investigation with
the view of making human life, that of self and of all
who come or can be brought within the range of one's
influence, as long and happy as possible.</p>

<p>Any one who desires and endeavors rightly to learn,
interpret and live this law to these ends is moral. In
everything is he wholly good and in nothing at all bad.</p>

<p>Religion is not anything good, except only as it is
a synonym of such morality, and this is equally true
of politics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>War shortens much life and fills more with misery,
hence it is utterly immoral, and this is equally true of
poverty and slavery.</p>

<p>In what I say here and in some other places about
war being essentially evil, the wars referred to are
those by which the world has been cursed through all
the ages&mdash;wars between different groups of owners
with conflicting interests, not the war between owners
and workers which is now on. This war will bless, not
curse, the world, because it is for the emancipation of
the slave class, not for the enrichment of one group
of the masters at the expense of another group, at the
cost of increased misery to all the slaves on both sides.</p>

<p>If there is any truth in the representation that real
religion and real politics alike consist in desiring and
endeavoring to make terrestrial life (there is no celestial
life of which aught is known) long and happy,
the advocate of war is the worst of heretics against
Christianism and the worst of traitors against Americanism.</p>

<p>War is a necessary characteristic of vegetables and
animals, because they cannot make and operate machines
for the supplying of their needs.</p>

<p>Peace is the necessary characteristic of humans, because
they can make and operate machines for the supplying
of their needs.</p>

<p>Wars between capitalists are inevitabilities, as much
so as the wars between two hungry dogs, when one
has a bone upon which the lives of both depend. The
only difference between capitalists and dogs is, that
dogs do their own fighting, whereas capitalists first
rob the laborers who produce their commodities, and
then persuade or compel them to fight their battles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with fellow capitalists in their competitive efforts to
distribute them.</p>

<p>On the one hand it is true that a few capitalists do
lose money in wars, and still fewer their lives, but on
the other hand it is equally true that the majority of
them are made richer and that producing and distributing
laborers ultimately bear every cent of the enormous
financial burden, and that for every machine
owning master who is killed or wounded there are a
hundred wage earning slaves.</p>

<p>Yet neither the making nor operating of machines
constitutes a man a human. It is co-operation which
does this. Nor will co-operation in itself suffice. Bees
and ants co-operate and even capitalists do so, yet with
all their co-operating bees and ants remain animals
and so do capitalists. The co-operation which converts
animals into humans is the one which is purposely
inaugurated and sustained with the view of
securing to each one the fruits of his labor while at the
same time increasing them for all&mdash;that deliberate co-operation
which consists in conscious living, letting
live and helping to live.</p>

<p>It is this co-operation which constitutes the most
essential difference between the animal and the human.
Only animalism can exist and flourish on a competitive
basis, yet this is the basis upon which men
who falsely claim to be humans are living.</p>

<p>Until mankind begins the construction of a civilization
on a foundation of co-operation in the production
and distribution of the necessities of life, it should not
set up a claim to humanism for itself, because meantime
it cannot sustain such a claim.</p>

<p>It is perfectly natural and absolutely necessary for
dogs to have belligerent contentions for bones, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
they cannot peacefully co-operate in the making of
them; and yet men who can do this are more fierce by
far in their competitive struggles for the bones which
are necessities to their lives.</p>

<p>Revolutionary socialists of the Marxian or Bolshevikian
type offer the only solution of the two great
questions of the world at this time: (1) how to save
it from its intermittent and lesser hell of suffering by
the bloody wars between rival sets of capitalists, and
(2) how to save it from its perpetual and greater hell
of suffering by the bloodless wars between the machine
owning masters and the machine operating
slaves, which wars, if less excruciating, are yet more
destructive of both life and happiness.</p>

<p>1. As to the bloody wars, a league of nations could
prevent them only while the dogs are sleeping off their
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Nor could government ownership be depended upon
for protection. It would increase the armies and
navies, making it next to impossible that more than a
decade or two should pass before our children must
suffer as much as, or more than, we have by the recent
war between the bull dog and the blood hound.</p>

<p>We are not at all indebted to the victory of the bull
dog (England) over the blood hound (Germany) for
what we have in the way of a guarantee against future
wars, but wholly to the presumption of the Newfoundland
dog (Russia) which has quietly walked off with
the bone of contention while the belligerents were
scrapping over it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all appearances and impressions to
the contrary, this bone never was really Paris or Berlin,
but first one and then another country&mdash;the Balkan
States, Mexico, Persia, Morocco and Russia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Of late Russia has been the chief bone of contention.
Hence all the snarling against Russian Bolshevism,
one of a large litter of puppies born to the Newfoundland
since the beginning of the war, representatives of
which have already made their way to several countries
of Europe, and the prospects are that they or
their offspring will soon be in evidence everywhere
throughout the world.</p>

<p>When all these Bolsheviki are grown-ups, they will
make the world safe for democracy sure enough&mdash;not
the competitive democracy of the bull dogs and blood
hounds, but the co-operative democracy of the Newfoundland
dog. Then, and not before, will the world
be safe against war.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the armistice there has been,
every now and then, a widespread fear that it might
not be permanent, because of a successful effort on the
part of the bull dog to put over another war on account
of the Russian bone; but for many this fear has now
been almost quieted by the total collapse of the Kolchak,
Denikin, Yudenich and Wrangel uprisings from
within, which were strongly supported by the Allies;
and by the repulsion of the Polish invasion which had
England, France and the United States behind it.</p>

<p>An astonishing illustration of the truth of the Marxian
theory concerning the materialistic or economic
determination of history, is furnished by the melancholy
fact that the representatives of big business in
the allied countries would gladly respond to Gen.
Ludendorff's call to join the junkers, against whom
they so recently fought, in a war against Russia, of
which war Germany would be the battle field. A concerted
effort was made to organize such a war, but the
wisdom learned in the school of the world war by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
working-men of all the countries to which the call was
made and their consequent opposition to the effort caused
it to fail.</p>

<p>2. But great as the suffering of the world is on account
of the bloody wars of capitalists with each other,
it is but a drop in the bucket of sorrow as compared
with its suffering on account of the bloodless wars between
masters and slaves&mdash;between the machine owners
and operators. When this bloodless war ceases,
as it will with the triumph of international socialism,
the bloody wars will cease and not until then.</p>

<p>Under the capitalist system every institution (state,
church, school, legislature, court, business, yes, even
charity) is necessarily a robbing instrumentality by
which a small class of non-producers, fat masters, rob
a large class of producers, lean slaves, and rob them
twice, each time thrice:</p>

<p>1. The master non-producers rob the slave producers
of the three great necessities of physical (body)
life&mdash;food, clothing and houses.</p>

<p>Even in the United States of America, "the land of
plenty," at this time and at all times, seventy-five out
of every one hundred are insufficiently fed, clothed and
housed.</p>

<p>2. The master non-producers rob the slave producers
of the necessities of psychical (soul) life&mdash;the liberty
to learn the facts of nature, the liberty to humanly
interpret and live them and the liberty to teach their
discoveries and interpretations.</p>

<p>Even in the United States of America, "the home
of political and religious freedom," there is not one
who can learn, live and teach the truth without danger
of being put out of a synagogue and into a peni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>tentiary;
and this will continue until imperialistic
capitalism and supernaturalistic Christianism, the father
and mother of the whole brood of robbers, liars,
persecutors and warriors, have been dethroned.</p>

<p>The gods of the capitalistic interpretations of politics
and the gods of the supernaturalistic interpretations
of religion, symbolize the same reality, parasitic
robbery.</p>

<p>Yet within the religious realm the trouble is not
with the Jehovahs any more than within the political
realm it is with the Sams, but only with what they
symbolize.</p>

<p>For one I should feel that both the religious and political
realms, which are but halves of the same realm&mdash;religion
the ideal half, and politics the practical half&mdash;would
be poorer without their respective Jehovahs
and Sams, even as the realm of childhood would be
without its Santa Claus.</p>

<p>If symbols are not absolute necessities to the religious
and political realms, nevertheless they always
have been, now are and probably ever shall be ornaments
of them; I hope for their continuance, but as
subjectivities, not objectivities.</p>

<p>All the imperialistic interpretations of politics and
all the supernaturalistic interpretations of religion must
be overthrown, else the world will be lost. The omnipotent,
omnipresent saviour who can and will deliver
us from them is already in the world. His name
is International Communism, the greatest and holiest
name which has ever been framed and pronounced;
and the gospel of this saviour as it is translated by
Thomas Carlyle is written on every wall so that it
may be read by all:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Understand that well, it is the deep commandment,
dimmer or clearer, of our whole being, to be freed.
Freedom is the one purpose, wisely aimed at, or unwisely,
of all man's struggles, toilings, and sufferings,
on this earth.</p></div>

<p>Morality is the greatest thing in the world because
without it human life would not be worth the living,
or even possible; but, paradoxical as the assertion may
seem, freedom or liberty is greater because without it
morality would be an impossibility.</p>

<p>One can attain to the very highest standard of
morality, religion and sainthood without the least
necessity of the slightest reference to what the gods
of the supernaturalistic religions said or did, and this
is quite as true of Jesus as of any other among such
gods, but no man can reach even the lowest standard
of morality, and so of course not of religion or sainthood,
without constant reference to the god of truth.</p>

<p>Yet there is a difference between a law and a truth.
The law is a doing or act of nature, and as such it is a
fact or revelation. There are no other facts or revelations.</p>

<p>According to the traditional superstitious conception,
a truth is the revelation of the will of a god, involving
a service to be rendered directly or indirectly
to him, and morality consists in a fulfillment of it.</p>

<p>According to the modern scientific conception, a
truth is the interpretation of a fact involving a service
to be rendered to men. On the scientific theory each
man must have what truth he has, either by his own
interpretation or by the adoption for himself of another's
interpretation.</p>

<p>No man can live the moral part of his psychical
(soul) life on the truth of another any more than he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
can live his physical (body) life on the meals of another.
Every one must have his own truths, even as
he must have his own meals.</p>

<p>Hence the necessity of freedom to morality. Hence,
too, the impossibility of the moral life under restraint,
such as is imposed by orthodox churches in their official
dogmas, and such as is imposed by belligerent
states in their espionage laws.</p>

<p>Capitalism is essentially competitive and therefore
necessarily belligerent in character: hence a complete,
an ideal moral life is an utter impossibility under it,
but even the little of moral life which otherwise might be
possible is lessened to one-half by official dogmas and
espionage laws; if, then, the governments of churches
and nations have any regard for the morality of their
memberships and citizenships they will at once repeal
them, and never enact others.</p>

<p>The democracy which means freedom to learn the
laws of the physical realm of nature and to interpret
them into laws for the regulation of human life (a
democracy which will secure to each one the longest
and happiest life which, under the most favorable of
conditions, would be within the range of possibilities
for him) must wait until the competitive system of
capitalism for the production and distribution of the
necessities has been universally and completely supplanted
by the co-operative system of socialism.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the whole matter, as it is well put
by an able contributor to the excellent Proletarian, is
this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is needed is a complete revolution of the
economic system. Private ownership of the tools of
wealth production stands in the way of further peaceful
social development and private ownership must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
eliminated. The capitalists themselves will not eliminate
it. That is certain. It remains for the working
class to do so. In order to accomplish this task it will
be necessary for the workers to take control of the
institution by which the capitalists maintain their
ownership of the tools of production&mdash;the political
state. That is the historic mission of the working
class. The mission of the Socialist is to organize and
train the workers for this "conquest of political
power."</p></div>

<p>Among the signs of the times which unmistakably
point to the great day of the happy consummation of
the movement towards the proletarian revolution, and
the glorious sky is full of them, is the fact that the
world has recently learned from the great war that
man must work out his own salvation without the
least help from the gods of the supernaturalistic interpretations
of religion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die,</span>
<span class="i0">Lift not your hands to It for help&mdash;for It</span>
<span class="i0">As impotently moves as you or I.</span>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<span class="right">&mdash;Omar.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, and a god moves more impotently than a man;
for, whereas the god is driven hither and thither by
the laws of matter and force, according to which they
co-exist and co-operate through evolutionary processes
to the making of the universe what it is, and the god
cannot help himself by making it or conditioning himself
otherwise, the man, if only he will learn those
laws, may combine, guide and ride them to almost any
predetermined destination, even out of the class hell
of competitive capitalism to the classless heaven of
co-operative socialism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<h4>III.</h4>

<p>The salvation of the world from its unnecessary
sufferings is dependent upon such an equitable sharing
of the labor involved in the making and operating of
the machines of production and distribution, and upon
such an equitable sharing of the products as shall issue
in a classless mankind by doing away, through a revolution,
with the class which lives by owning the means
and machines of production and distribution.</p>

<p>It is this advocacy of classless levelism which constitutes
the theoretical core of revolutionary socialism.
Those who oppose this socialism proceed upon the
assumption of the permanency of existing religious
and political institutions, the most ruinous of all
heresies.</p>

<p>What this heresy is and the fatal policy to which it
gives rise has its classic expression, so far as religion
is concerned, in the exhortation&mdash;"earnestly contend
for the faith once for all delivered to the saints"&mdash;and,
so far as politics is concerned, in the representation&mdash;"the
laws of the Medes and Persians which altereth
not."</p>

<p>There is no such faith in religion, and cannot be, for
as a creed becomes stereotyped it loses the religious
character and degenerates into superstition.</p>

<p>There are no such laws in politics, and cannot be,
for as a law becomes stereotyped it loses the political
character and degenerates into tyranny.</p>

<p>Religion, which is the ideal half, and politics, which
is the practical half, of the same reality, human socialism,
are like all else in the universe, constantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
changing, and necessarily so, because life and progress
are dependent upon change.</p>

<p>Orthodoxy in religion and politics is the blight of
the ages, because of its assumption that the great institutions,
the family, state and church with their customs,
laws and doctrines, as they exist for the time
being, constitute the foundation of society, without
which it could not exist; that these institutions are
almost if not altogether what they should be, and that,
therefore, the welfare of society, if not indeed its
existence, is dependent upon their continuance with
but little if any change.</p>

<p>But the foundation of society always has been a
system for the production and distribution of the
necessities of life, and hence social institutions, customs,
laws and creeds are what they are at any time
because an economic system is what it is.</p>

<p>If we compare an economic system for the production
of the primary necessities of life (foods,
clothes and houses) to a king or bishop (we may
well do so, for in all ages such systems have been
the power behind every regal and episcopal throne)
we shall see that states, with their rulers, codes and
police, armies and jails; and churches, with their gods,
revelations, heavens and hells, are but so many expediencies
for the protection of the system from
change.</p>

<p>What is true in this respect of the state and church
is equally so of the family, the school, the press, the
lodge, the club, the library, the theater, the chautauqua
and, in short, every institution.</p>

<p>Why all these age-long safeguards against change?
Because, so far, every economic system has divided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
society into two classes, a comparatively small class
who own things and a large one who make things,
and if the few honest owners are to hold their own
as divinely favored "grab-it-alls," they must be protected
at every point against the many dishonest
makers who are diabolically tempted to be "keep-somes!"</p>

<p>These rounded out children of god have nothing in
common with these caved in imps of the devil, no
more than the flea and the dog, or the tapeworm and
the man.</p>

<p>David hastily said: All men are liars. He might
leisurely have said this of every representative of any
religious or political orthodoxy, for they insist that
their religion and politics are the permanent elements
in social truth which remain unchanged from
generation to generation through all ages, whereas no
religion or politics continues the same during one decade,
nor even a single year.</p>

<p>Orthodox Christians say that Jesus founded their
sectarian churches, though each sect insists that he
had to do with only one church, theirs. I doubt that
he lived. In any case, I am certain that if he did
live and founded a church in the first century and
were to come to earth again in this twentieth century,
he could not if he would and would not if he
could become a member of it, because of its changes.</p>

<p>Our own country is different by the width of the
whole space of the heavens from what it was before
the war, and it is destined to a much wider change.</p>

<p>So far are churches with their doctrines, and states
with their laws from being changeless, that they are
more or less modified by every development in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
economic system to which they owe their existence
and of which they are servants.</p>

<p>In the case of every nation its king, the economic
system, has always been a robber and enslaver of the
overwhelming majority of the people, and the church
and state have been the hands by which he accomplished
the robbing and enslaving.</p>

<p>Insofar as they differ, Roman orthodoxy is what
it is because of its starting out as the religious
product of the feudal system of economics; and
Protestant orthodoxy is what it is because of its
starting out as the religious product of the capitalistic
system of economics.</p>

<p>Protestantism is preferred before Romanism by
most of the leading people in the financial world, because
it is the child of capitalism, their sister, so to
speak, whereas its rival is only a cousin.</p>

<p>As to the Roman and Protestant orthodoxies they
are on the same footing. I would not turn my hand
over for the difference between them. If literally
interpreted in the light of modern science, both are
utterly antiquated and irrational.</p>

<p>Orthodox Romanists and Protestants have essentially
the same bible and creed. In my opinion,
as in that of all Marxian and Darwinian socialists,
every supernaturalistic representation in both must
be regarded as having either a figurative or a
superstitious character, for there is not one among
them which can endure a scientific and rational
analysis; yet, this is an age of science and reason.</p>

<p>The difference between Romanism and Protestantism
is not at all a question of relative supernaturalism,
nor of rightness and wrongness, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
wholly one of the difference between the systems of
economics which gave them birth.</p>

<p>If you ask, is not this difference at least partly a
question of the age in which they took their rise, I
reply, yes; but the age itself depends upon the system.</p>

<p>However, it is a fact that while an economic system
does constitute the foundation of every religious
and political superstructure, yet below the
foundation itself there is always a bed rock upon
which it ultimately rests, and this is a question
of machinery by which the necessities of life are produced
and distributed.</p>

<p>The age of feudalism was essentially traditional or
theoretical in its character.</p>

<p>The age of capitalism is essentially scientific or
experimental in its character.</p>

<p>This difference between these ages is due to the
fact that during the earlier age things were made with
hand tools, and during the later one with machine
tools.</p>

<p>Machinery in a theoretical or traditional age would
be an anachronism. It must have an experimental or
scientific age for its development, and, paradoxical as
it may seem, this the machinery must make for itself.
Every period in human history has had its
determining character from the tools which brought
it into being.</p>

<p>Supernaturalism has no place in the observations,
investigations or experimentations which are necessary
to the invention, construction and operation of
a great machine and, hence, the machines have
banished the gods from the roof of the earth and the
devils from its cellar, leaving it to us to make of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
what we please, a heaven or a hell without reference
to them. In his brilliant work entitled "Social and
Philosophical Studies", translated by Charles H. Kerr,
Paul Lafargue writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The labour of the mechanical factory puts the wage-worker
in touch with terrible natural forces unknown
to the peasant, but instead of being mastered by them
he controls them. The gigantic mechanism of iron
and steel which fills the factory, which makes him
move like an automaton, which sometimes clutches
him, bruises him, mutilates him, does not engender
in him a superstitious terror as the thunder does in
the peasant, but leaves him unmoved, for he knows
that the limbs of the mechanical monster were
fashioned and mounted by his comrades, and that he
has but to push a lever to set it in motion or stop it.
The machine, in spite of its miraculous power and
productiveness, has no mystery for him. The labourer
in the electrical works, who has but to turn a crank
on a dial to send miles of motive power to tramways,
or light the lamps of a city, has but to say, like the
God of Genesis, "let there be light," and there is light.
Never sorcery more fantastic was imagined, yet for
him this sorcery is a simple and natural thing. He
would be greatly surprised if one were to come and
tell him that a certain god might, if he chose, stop the
machines and extinguish the lights when the electricity
had been turned on; he would reply that this
anarchistic god would be simply a misplaced gearing
or a broken wire, and that it would be easy for him
to seek and find this disturbing god. The practice of
the modern factory teaches scientific determinism to
the wage-worker, without it being necessary for him
to pass through the theoretic study of the sciences.</p></div>

<p>Earth must be a hell as long as we allow the
capitalist system to continue on it and to enslave the
vast majority of its inhabitants. Marxian socialism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
will ring out the old era with its hell of human
slavery and ring in the new era with its heaven of
machine slavery.</p>

<p>One point must be grasped and held by all who
would understand the changes which take place
within the social realm and it is this: they are due
to the differences in the instrumentalities or machines
by which the necessities of life are produced.</p>

<p>Man has risen above the lower animals which have
common ancestors with his own, because of the
superiority of the hand by which he does things to
the hands by which they do things. If a man's body
in general and hand in particular were not a great
improvement over the bodies and hands of the apes,
his mind and morality would differ but little from
theirs.</p>

<p>The superiority of the civilization of this age over
its predecessors is a question of instrumentalities by
which the efficiency of the hand is increased.</p>

<p>If all the modern machinery were taken from this
generation and replaced by the implements of the
stone age the civilization of the next generation would
begin to sink, and within a century it would reach
the ancient level.</p>

<p>Strong expression is also given to the great truth
upon which we are here dwelling by the Socialist
Party of Great Britain in its noteworthy Manifesto:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Obviously, in order that there may be ideas and
human history, two material things must first be
present: human beings, and food and shelter for them.
And the fundamental fact that is so seldom realized
is, that where, by what means, and how much, food
and shelter can be obtained, determines if, where, and
how, man shall live, and the forms his social institutions
and ideas shall take.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, indeed, the very basis of Socialist philosophy
that, in the words of Frederick Engels:</p>

<p>"In every historical epoch the prevailing mode of
economic production and exchange, and the social
organization necessarily following from it, form the
basis upon which is built up, and from which, alone
can be explained, the political and intellectual history
of that epoch."</p>

<p>This materialist concept is the Socialist key to history.
It is the first principle of a science of society,
and, being directly antagonistic to all religious philosophy,
it is destined to drive this "philosophy" and
all its superstitions from their last ditch.</p></div>

<p>Civilization will not die with the death of the
capitalist system of production any more than it did
with the feudal system. It improved under capitalism,
because of the improvement in the machinery of production,
and it is destined to continue its progress
so long as new and better machines are made and
this will be to the end.</p>

<p>Marxian socialism is a machine optimism. Under
this socialism the number and efficiency of machines
would increase more rapidly than they have under
capitalism and feudalism, because its aim will be
the production of commodities for use within the
shortest time by the least exertion at the slightest
risk of injury.</p>

<p>Up to the point of over production, that is, of glutting
the markets, it is to the interest of capitalism to
encourage improvements in machinery, but the
ability to do this has been reached, as is evident
from what we hear at increasingly frequent intervals
about an over production of commodities.</p>

<p>What machinery we now have renders it possible
to produce more commodities than can be sold with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>out
employing all the labor power. But the idle,
starving slave is a danger to the idle, surfeiting master.
Hence, under capitalism there can be no further
development of machinery, at least not on a large
scale.</p>

<p>An industrial government would have for its aim
to produce enough of everything for all with the least
expenditure of energy and time. Hence, the greatest
benefactors and heroes under socialism would be the
inventors of labor saving, leisure giving machinery.</p>

<p>We hear much about the mental superiority of the
representatives of the master class over those of the
slave class, but there is little or no truth in it.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it can be shown that the invention
of a great labor saving, rapid-producing machine is,
upon the whole, the greatest triumph of the human
mind and that nearly all among such machines are
invented, made, operated, kept in order and improved
by the laborer.</p>

<p>Masters may be more cunning than slaves, but
cunningness is not an evidence of a high order of
intellectual power. Many of the lower animals are
quite the equals, if not indeed the superiors, of
capitalists in this quality, but no animal is the equal
of any man, not to speak of the exceptionally skilled
laborer, in the power to produce efficient machines
for the production and distribution of the necessities
of life.</p>

<p>Romanism began its career as a child of the feudal
system for the production and distribution of commodities
for the profit of the owners of the land and
the means for its cultivation. The mission to which
it was born was the assistance of its father, feudalism,
in robbing and enslaving the workers who tilled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
soil, and never did a servant more faithfully or
efficiently perform a task during a longer period.</p>

<p>Protestantism began its career as a child of the
capitalistic system for the production and distribution
of commodities for the profit of the owners of the
means and machines for their manufacturing. The
mission to which it was born was the assistance of
its father, capitalism, in robbing and enslaving the
workers, who make and operate the machines, and
never did a servant more faithfully and efficiently perform
a task in a larger or more fruitful field.</p>

<p>Hitherto all systems of economics have had the
same soul, competition; and, because of it, every one
among them has been a diabolical trinity of which
lying is the father; robbing is the son, who proceeds
from the father; and murder is the spirit, who proceeds
from the father and the son.</p>

<p>Labor, "the certain man" of every nation, is half
dead lying in the ditch by the wayside, despoiled and
wounded, the victim of capitalism, the greatest liar,
robber and murderer of all the ages.</p>

<p>The church is the archangel or prime minister
through which this Beelzebub, capitalism, has done
most of his lying, though within the last hundred
years the business has become so great that the office
of coadjutor to this archangel was created, and the
press appointed to it.</p>

<p>The state is the archangel or prime minister through
which this prince of devils, capitalism, has done most
of his robbing and killing, though the church has
often taken a helpful hand in these departments of
the devil's work, the great work of converting earth
into a hell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly all of the backwardness of the world and
more than half of its unnecessary sufferings have been
due to efforts to prevent changes in religion and
politics. Our nation is passing through the darkest
period of its history because of such efforts on the
part of the powers which be in the state, and they
are supported by those in the church.</p>

<p>Speaking of the change with which we are here
especially concerned, the one involved in the supplanting
of an old economic system by a new, there
have been several revolutions due to such changes,
and another is inevitable and imminent.</p>

<p>When an economic system fails, as the capitalistic
one is failing, to feed, clothe and house the workers
of the world who produce all foods, clothes and
houses, the time when it must give place to another
is manifestly near at hand.</p>

<p>Capitalism is failing in this, the only legitimate
mission of an economic system. It has indeed over-supplied
the needs of about one in ten, but in doing
this it has shown partiality, for the remaining nine
are left more or less foodless, clotheless and houseless,
and this notwithstanding they have done all the
feeding, clothing and housing. Those favored by the
system will not be able to prevent its overthrow by
those who are wronged.</p>

<p>With our materials, factories, railroads and skill,
all should have enough and to spare of every necessity,
but so far is this from being the case that millions
are insufficiently fed, clothed, housed and warmed,
and are doomed to a perpetual and exhaustive
drudgery which leaves neither leisure nor energy for
the cultivation of their soul life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The economical and statistical experts of our
government's Department of Labor represent that
the bare necessities of a comfortable and efficient life
for a family of five require an annual income of
$1,500, and that the simple luxuries, which are next
to being indispensable, require an additional $1,000,
in all $2,500, per year.</p>

<p>How many American families of five have even the
smaller of these sums at their disposal? The overwhelming
majority have less than $1,000. Let us be
honest with the peoples of other nations by ceasing
to speak of our country as "the land of plenty and
the home of the free," until there is a great change
for the better.</p>

<p>Wage slavery may be prolonged by a military
coercion but it cannot have a successor in any other
form of human slavery. Military coercion prolonged
chattel slavery, and by so doing brought what is
known as the dark ages upon the world. If wage
slavery is to be prolonged by military coercion the
world must pass through a second dark age. The
league of nations is fixing for this; but let us hope
that this coalition will not stand and that wage
slavery will soon be followed by machine slavery, the
form of slavery which will end human slavery; not
until then shall we have peace on earth and good will
among men.</p>

<p>Then they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not
lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn
war any more.</p>

<p>Do you not now see with me that the christ of the
world is not a conscious, personal god, but an un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>conscious,
impersonal machine? It is the machine
of man, not a lamb of god, to which we may hopefully
look for the taking away of the sins of the
world.</p>

<p>Ignorance is the great misfortune of the world, its
devil, and slavery is his hell. The machine is the
redeemer who shall save man from this devil and
hell.</p>

<p>Yes, strange, even blasphemous, as the representation
may seem, it is nevertheless true, the machine
is the only name given under heaven whereby the
world can be saved.</p>

<p>Civilization is salvation. The civilization which
is salvation depends on leisure and it on slavery, but
so long as leisure is dependent upon the slavery of
man, civilization must be limited to a diminishing
few.</p>

<p>Marxian socialism is a movement towards the
equalization and universalization of leisure by doing
away with the master and slave classes, through
transference of slavery from man to machine.</p>

<p>If there is any truth in my naturalistic representation
about the dependence of morality upon a system
for the production of the necessities of life, there
is none in the supernaturalistic one, which makes it
dependent on any among the gods; and, what is true
of the realm of morality is equally so of the realm of
history, and this whether it be the history of the
universe in general or man in particular.</p>

<p>Lavoisier and Mayer showed that no god (Jesus,
Jehovah, Allah, Buddha) created the universe out of
nothing, for the matter and force which enter into its
constitution are eternalities and universalities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Kant and Laplace showed that the earth and the
heavenly bodies were not created by any god at all,
but evolved from gaseous nebulae.</p>

<p>Kepler and Newton showed that these bodies were not
governed in their motions by a god but by the law
of gravitation.</p>

<p>Darwin and Wallace showed that the species of
animal and vegetable life were not created by any
among the gods, but evolved from a common protoplasm.</p>

<p>Marx and Engels showed that man's career has not
been determined by any among the gods, but by his
systems for producing and distributing the necessities
of life.</p>

<p>These ten men are the greatest teachers the world
has had, and this is the sum of all their great teachings:
The universe is self-existing, self-sustaining
and self-governing, having all the potentialities of its
own life within itself, and what is true of it in general
is equally so of all the phenomena which enter into
its constitution, including man; who, though he is
the highest among them, is only a phenomenon, on a
level with all the rest, not excepting the lowest. A
microbe and a man are on the same footing, both as
to their origin and destiny, and as to their having
within themselves all power which is available for
making the most of their respective lives.</p>

<p>Darwinism and Marxism constitute one gospel, the
only true, comprehensive and sufficient gospel which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the world has ever had or can have, and there is no
hope for the future of mankind except in it. If it
fails the world is lost, but it shall not and indeed cannot
fail, for its words are so many acts or facts of
nature.</p>

<p>There is no fact which is not such an act, and every
such fact is a part of the one only law upon the
knowing and doing of which terrestrial life and its
happiness are wholly and solely dependent.</p>

<p>Yes, life, long life, happy life, all there is of such
human life, or divine life, (if there be any), depends
entirely upon a knowledge of and conformity to this
law which is the doing of nature, and not at all upon
any law which is the willing of a god, if indeed there
is such a law.</p>

<p>Neither the religion nor the politics which enters
into the constitution of Marxian or proletarian
socialism is at all concerned about the heaven above
or the hell below the earth, if there are such places:
but the concern of both is wholly to ring out a hell
from the earth and to ring in a heaven upon it.</p>

<p>Nor have the religion and politics which constitute
this socialism the least concern about the service of
a celestial divinity (Jesus, Jehovah, Allah, Buddha or
any other) by doing his will; but both are much concerned
with the service of humanity, which consists
in rightly learning, interpreting and using the laws
of nature, wholly for the purpose of making the
terrestrial lives of men, women and children as long
and happy as possible, and with absolutely no
reference to any celestial life which may be either
above or below the earth.</p>

<p>Religion and politics are the complementary and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
inseparable halves of the social sphere, religion being
its idealism and politics its practicalism.</p>

<p>Religious idealism is a social soul of which the
church should be the embodiment.</p>

<p>Political practicalism is a social soul of which the
state should be the embodiment.</p>

<p>Contrary to the representations of orthodox
Christianism it is impossible for any soul to exist
without an embodiment.</p>

<p>In truth the body produces the soul, not the soul
the body. We must have the church and state in
order that we may have their souls, idealism and
practicalism.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>The church and the state are on the same level as
to their origin and importance. Both are human institutions
and each is indispensable to the other. It
is not at all desirable or possible to rid the world of
either, but it is absolutely necessary that both should
be revolutionized, the church by having its bible and
creed rewritten or at least reinterpreted, on the basis
of truth as it is revealed by nature, and the state by
having its institutions reorganized on the basis of
service to all instead of only to those of a small class,
the owner or master class.</p>

<p>All the idealistic aims of churches and all the
practical undertakings of states should be directly
concerned with the answer to three questions: (1)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the question as to how to reach the goal where
terrestrial life shall in the case of each man, woman
and child be as long and happy as it is within the
range of possibilities to make it, by the fullest of
attainable knowledge concerning the laws of nature;
(2) the question as to how to make the most successful
endeavor universally to disseminate such knowledge,
and (3) the question as to how resistlessly to
persuade to the living of it.</p>

<p>These are the only concerns and aims of Marxian
socialism and they cannot be promoted or even
avowed by Christian socialists.</p>

<p>The great crime of the ages is the robbing of the
producer of the basic necessities of human life by the
non-producer.</p>

<p>Capitalism is the robber, and the politics and religion
of the old states and churches are the right and
left hands by which he has been and is doing the
robbing.</p>

<p>Marxian socialism is an undertaking which has for
its task the overthrow of the system which makes it
possible for those who produce nothing to live
surfeitingly, and renders it necessary for those who
produce everything to live starvingly.</p>

<p>Poverty is a disease caused by the unjust wage
system of competitive capitalism for producing and
distributing the necessities of life (food, clothing and
shelter) for the profit of capitalists, the few who live
by owning the materials and machines of production
and distribution; and this blighting malady cannot
be cured by charity, but it will spread until this system
is supplanted by the just one of co-operative
industrialism, a system by which these necessities shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
be produced and distributed for the use of laborers,
those who live by making and operating the machines.</p>

<p>Every gift to charity by a rich man is a robbery of
a poor man. You will not see this at once, if ever,
and I shall not blame you for the failure to do so. It
was not seen by me until I was much older than you;
but I am now seeing it as clearly as I ever saw the
sun on a cloudless noonday, and this is true of rapidly
growing millions who are resolutely resolved to do
away with the prevailing conception of charity, according
to which capitalists may rob laborers of the
fruit of their toil, giving them of it barely enough to
keep body and soul together and to raise up children
who are doomed to follow in their footsteps; and
then, when the strength of their victim fails, to make
amends for the robberies, by giving the most highly
favored among them beds in hospitals, poor-houses
in which to die prematurely, and nameless graves in
potter's fields in which to await hopefully a resurrection
and ascension to an inheritance of happiness in a
sky, which was denied them on the earth.</p>

<p>The time is at hand when everywhere the unemployed
and the underpaid shall begin a resistless march towards
the goal of economic levelism under a banner containing
this slogan: We want no charity but the right to
work and the fruits of our labors that we and our helpless
dependents may have every necessity to the fullest
life for body and soul.</p>

<p>During more than a whole generation Mrs. Brown
and I have not produced a spoonful of any food,
a thread of any garment or a shingle of any
house; and yet we have had foods, garments and
houses in abundance with some to spare, while their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
producers have had them in scarcity with much to
want.</p>

<p>While the world war was on, an ill wind for the
producers blew a thousand dollars to us and an ill
wind for us blew it into the hands of a committee,
ostensibly for investment on behalf of a hospital of
which we approved, but really for the purchase of a
bond in the interest of a war of which we disapproved.</p>

<p>The fathers of the present generation of producers
and distributors of the necessities of life were robbed
in order that we might inherit the property from
which our income is derived; the sons and daughters
are being robbed over and over again and again, year
after year, in order that the property may continue
to yield this income to us.</p>

<p>We therefore paid nothing of our own for this
bond. What we gave for it was of the spoils which
the great robber, capitalism, has bestowed upon us,
its favorite children, from what it has taken from its
unfortunate victims.</p>

<p>The same persons or their children and successors
were or shall be robbed first to create our
property, then to pay the income of it, next to buy
the bond, and now they are being robbed to meet the
interest on it and finally they will be robbed to pay
its face value. If capitalism stands, of course the
victims of the last of these robberies will belong,
probably, to a remote generation; but this delay is a
misfortune in store for many of all intervening
generations.</p>

<p>If the robbery connected with this bond were
limited to its original cost, one thousand dollars, and
to its accruing interest, which is likely in time to ag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>gregate
several thousand dollars, it would indeed be
bad enough, yet not nearly as much so as it is under the
melancholy circumstances; for the money paid on
account of the bond goes towards killing or wrecking
its producers, if not those who produced this particular
thousand dollars, yet others of their class to
whom the world owes all of its wealth; therefore the
thousand dollars which went into this bond has been
devoted to the robbery of those who were robbed of
it and of the most precious of all things: life and limb.</p>

<p>You will ask: how can you and Mrs Brown, in the
face of your theory, according to which all who live
by owning are robbers of those who live by working,
consistently receive and expend the income of your
inheritance?</p>

<p>The answer was given to a friend who asked us why
we did not follow the heroic example of a young American
who had recently renounced what had been inherited
by him, and this is, in effect, what we said:</p>

<p>As we look at the question, our course is more
rational than his, because the wealth which he renounces
may go to some one who is without his
sympathy for the proletariat. We prefer to receive
our inheritance and use it to overthrow the economic
system which makes it possible for us to do nothing
and have everything, and for those who do everything
to have nothing.</p>

<p>Capitalists, as such, people who live by the owning
of the machines of production and distribution, instead
of by the making and operating of them, have
much to say against the alleged anarchism of
socialists and yet they are necessarily what they
accuse anarchism of being, robbers and murderers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Every cent of profit, interest and rent is so much robbing,
and all wars are so many conflicts between the
capitalistic bandits or robbers in the countries involved,
and the peace conferences, which follow them, are so
many attempts of the bandits on the successful side to
have the spoils as large as possible, and to satisfactorily
divide them.</p>

<p>It is Holy Week 1921. The week in which during
all the years of many and long ages benighted
people sacrificed their Christs to Shylock gods. If
Jesus lived and was a Christ, unhappily He was
neither the first nor the last, for there were many
both before and after Him. Were they who superstitiously
led these victims to their Golgothas greater
sinners against humanity than those who did
avariciously during the war drive large armies of
young men to the terrible trenches, a wholesale sacrifice
of the lords of power and wealth and who do now
drive the vast majority of the nations involved in that
war to a terrible body and soul destroying poverty and
slavery? No. The modern robbers even more than
the ancient ones are in need of the prayer: Forgive
them for they know not what they do.</p>

<p>Communism and Christianism have, indeed, this in
common, that their object is to promote life, long life,
and happy life, both lives in a large and full measure,
pressed down, shaken together and running over.</p>

<p>Yet, with this sameness in the gospels of Communism
and Christianism there is this difference in the aims
of the christs who preached them, which separate them
as widely as the east is from the west, leaving a great
and impassable gulf between them.</p>

<p>Marx, the christ of the Communist gospel, said: I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
come that the world might have terrestrial life for
body, mind and soul, and have it for each in the
fullest of possible measures by co-operation with each
other in the discovery of the laws of nature and in
making them serve men, women and children by
securing for them food, clothing, shelter, health and
comfort for the body, and leisure for the mind to think
and for the soul to grow.</p>

<p>Jesus, the christ of the Christian gospel, according
to orthodoxy, said: I am come that ye might have
celestial life for mind, body and soul and have it for
each in the largest and fullest possible measure by
co-operation in persuading each other in particular
and the world in general to receive a revelation of
the will of a conscious, personal God, made through
prophets, preserved in the bible and interpreted by
the church.</p>

<p>With me it is a melancholy but resistless and
deepening conviction, that, if orthodox Christianism
should become associated with Marxian socialism, as
Kingsley and you would associate them, we should
soon have a glaring illustration of the truth of two
proverbs: a house divided against itself cannot
stand; and no man can serve two masters.</p>

<p>Moreover, I believe that if Christian socialism were
to become a door to Marxian socialism, through which
orthodox Christianism could enter and make itself
at home, the revolutionary aims of the slave class
would be thwarted and the world would enter upon
a new dark age, as it did when Constantine was converted
to Christianity and Christians became the
most loyal citizens and valiant soldiers of the Empire.</p>

<p>At that time chattel slavery had run its course as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
wage slavery has now; and, if it had not been prolonged
by a military despotism, as I fear this may
be, the world would have had something of the
feudal slavery, but nothing of the dark age. This
age was the baneful fruit of Christianism. Christianity
has held the world back from civilization instead of
advancing it towards civilization.</p>

<p>The Christianization of Marxian communism, in accordance
with the program of Kingsley and our
Church Socialist League, would spell another military
despotism for the prolongation of a second system of
slavery, which has run its course and is in a fair way
of being overthrown; but if the revolutionists fail,
as the result of being trampled under the iron heel,
we are at the threshold of a second dark age and
shall soon be passing through all the miseries of it.</p>

<p>My interest in the movement within our church
looking towards a Christian socialism of a more
radical and revolutionary type would be great, if only
I could feel as I should so much like, that the
Christian socialism to which you have consecrated
the whole prime of your life, and the Marxian
socialism, to which I have consecrated all of the little
that remains of mine, the fag-end, are not utter incompatibilities,
so much so that it is absolutely impossible
that they can co-exist and co-operate to any
good purpose.</p>

<p>The irreconcilable incompatibility of Christian
socialism and Marxian socialism is due to the fact
that, whereas the Christian is essentially imperialistic
in its character, the Marxian is as essentially democratic.
The reason for this fundamental and ineradicable difference,
and the consequent incompatibleness, is the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
that orthodoxism, whether Christian, Jewish, Mohammedan
or Buddhistic, is nothing unless it is supernaturalistic
and traditional; and Marxism is nothing
unless it is naturalistic and scientific, as much so as is
Darwinism.</p>

<p>In order that you may see the reason, as I understand
it, for this wide, deep and bridgeless difference,
I draw the following contrasts between the essential
beliefs of Marxian socialists and orthodox Christians:</p>

<p>1. Marxian socialism is essentially naturalistic.
Orthodox Christianism is essentially supernaturalistic.
The consistent socialist says: I have all the potentialities
of my own life within myself. The consistent
Christian says: My strength is from God.</p>

<p>2. Marxian socialism is essentially classless.
Orthodox Christianism is essentially a class system
by which the world is divided into two classes, saints
and sinners. The consistent socialist says: Every man
is my brother. The consistent Christian (like the
theist of every name&mdash;Jew, Mohammedan, Buddhist
and the rest) says: Every true believer is my brother,
but those who are not are only potential brethren.</p>

<p>3. Marxian socialism is essentially terrestrial.
Orthodox Christianism is essentially celestial. The
consistent socialist says: Earth is my home. The consistent
Christian says: Heaven is my home.</p>

<p>4. Marxian socialism is essentially materialistic.
Orthodox Christianism is essentially spiritualistic.
The consistent socialist says: The basic necessities of
life, and therefore its first concern, are foods, raiments,
shelters, comfort and leisure. The consistent Christian
says: Take no primary thought for these, but only for
faith in and obedience to God, regarding all else of
secondary importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Marxian socialism is essentially proletarian.
Orthodox Christianism is essentially bourgeois.
The consistent socialist says: I am, by reason of my
antecedents, a man, a woman, a child of nature on an
essential level as to my origin and destiny with every
other representative of humanity and indeed animality.
The consistent Christian, like the theist of every
name, says: I am (by reason of my faith, baptism or
conversion) a prince or princess, the son or daughter
of a king, God.</p>

<p>6. Marxian socialism is essentially democratic.
Orthodox Christianism is essentially imperialistic.
The consistent socialist says: I live with reference to
the will of the majority. The consistent Christian
says: I live with reference to the will of a God.</p>

<p>7. Marxian socialism is essentially pacific.<a name="Ftop" id="Ftop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#F">[F]</a></span>
Orthodox Christianism is essentially belligerent.
The consistent socialist says: Since you are a man, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>co-operate with you. The consistent Christian says:
Since you are not a believer, I contend with you.</p>

<p>8. Marxian socialism is essentially non-sectarian.
The consistent socialist says: All the world is my
home and the desire and effort to render service to
men, women and children is my religion. The consistent
Christian says: Only Christendom is my home
and the desire and effort to serve a God is my religion.</p>

<p>9. Marxian socialism is, as to the source of knowledge
and the means of attaining it, essentially scientific.
Orthodox Christianism is essentially traditional.
The consistent socialist says: The salvation of the
world is dependent upon what is learned by natural
experience, observation and investigation about the
doings of a matter-force-law, nature. The consistent
Christian says: This salvation depends upon what is
learned by revelation, tradition and inspiration about
the willings of a father-son-spirit, God.</p>

<p>10. Marxian socialism explains the history of mankind
on the naturalistic theory that it has been determined
during every period by the existing system
for supplying the materialistic necessities of life.
Orthodox Christianism explains this history on the
supernaturalistic theory that it is determined by the
providential directions of a triune divinity. The consistent
socialist says: If you will tell me of the
economic system by which a people have fed, clothed
and housed themselves, I will tell you, at least in
general outline, what has been their history. The
consistent Christian says: If you will tell me what the
providences of my God have been towards a people,
I will tell you their history.</p>

<p>11. Marxian socialism has inscribed on one of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
banners: Liberty. Orthodox Christianism has this
inscription on its corresponding banner: Obedience.
The consistent socialist says: This Liberty-banner is
the symbol of my freedom as a son of man to be
progressively learning, living and teaching the unfolding
revelations of nature&mdash;to know and to live
which is to have life, terrestrial life in an ever increasing
measure, all the life there is here and now
or elsewhere and elsewhen, if there is to be a conscious,
personal life anywhere or anywhen else. The
consistent Christian says: This Obedience-banner is
a symbol of my slavery as a son of God by which I
am bound to receive, live and teach the faith once for
all delivered to the saints in the Old and New Testaments
or else lose the permanent life in the sky which
is to follow this temporary one on the earth.</p>

<p>12. Marxian socialism has inscribed on another of
its banners: Justice to Man. Orthodox Christianism
has on its corresponding banner: Love to God. The
consistent socialist says: It is my aim to do unto
others as I would have them do unto me if our circumstances
were reversed. The consistent Christian says:
It is my aim to love God with all my heart, mind and
soul.</p>

<p>And if there be any further contrast between this
Christianism and Socialism, it is briefly comprehended
in these three statements,&mdash;in themselves sufficient to
show how absolutely impossible it is for a consistent
Jesuine Christian to be a consistent Marxian Socialist:</p>

<p>1. Marx seeks to save by doing away with both the
master and slave classes&mdash;Jesus by exalting the slave
class above the master class.</p>

<p>2. Marx exhorts the slave class to look to itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
for deliverance&mdash;Jesus taught it to look to a God for
this.</p>

<p>3. Marx promises salvation for this world here
and now, a world about which everybody knows
much&mdash;Jesus promised it for another world elsewhere
and elsewhen, a world about which nobody knows
anything.</p>

<p>The world has never had a gospel which is at all
comparable in its excellency to that of Marxian
Socialism. The gospel of Jesuine Christianism, according
to the orthodox interpretation of it, is no exception;
for, granting it to be superior to the Mosaic,
Buddhistic, Mohammedan and other gospels, it is,
nevertheless, almost infinitely inferior to the Marxian
gospel. Gospels are for the purpose of saving the
world from its suffering. The Jesuine and Marxian
gospels are alike in having for their object the salvation
of the proletarian world.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>About three years ago I discovered that I had
spent a long, strenuous and open-handed ministry in
preaching lies to the permanent ruin of my health and
the temporary embarrassment of my purse; therefore
I had the unhappy experience of being forced
to see that all this part of my life, its prime, had
been mostly, if not wholly wasted and worse. What
was to be done?</p>

<p>My friends told me as plainly as they could, and
some succeeded in making it brutally plain, that in
losing my faith in the supernaturalistic dogmas of
traditional Christianism, as they are literally in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>terpreted
in the doctrinal standards of the orthodox
churches, I had lost the pearl of great price.</p>

<p>My soul told me that I had never possessed this
jewel, but that, even with the little time and enfeebled
strength that remained to me, I might yet find it, if
only I should cease looking for it in the field of supernaturalism,
under the direction of divine authority,
and begin looking for it in the field of naturalism,
under the direction of human reason.</p>

<p>Happily, where faith went out courage came in, and
it increased with my desperation until (though
standing on the shore of death where the deep and
unknown stream lies darkly between the present and
future) I could and I did undertake the supreme task
of my life&mdash;the breaking of the chains by which I
was bound as a slave to the degrading superstition
that I was, both by an inherited and cultivated disposition,
a doomed man, and by an inherent weakness,
a helpless one with no power to emancipate myself.</p>

<p>Of such enslaving chains I mention three among
the strongest, the severed parts of which, with those
of all the rest, now lie scattered about me: (1) the
chain of the fear of God; (2) the chain of the fear
of the devil, and (3) the chain of the fear of man.</p>

<p>Hitherto I had been a child, thinking as a child,
understanding as a child and speaking as a child.</p>

<p>Henceforth I was to be a man, the greatest, conscious,
personal being who has anything to do with
this world; and as a man, I put away the things of a
child, especially the most childish of all things, fear,
the fear of God, the fear of devil and the fear of man.</p>

<p>Preachers of the supernaturalistic interpretations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of religion say that the fear of God is salvation. It
is damnation. No one who has fear of any conscious,
personal master whomsoever or wheresoever, God in
heaven, devil in hell or man on earth, is free or other
than a slave. Nor has any such attained to the full
stature of manhood.</p>

<p>There is only one fear which saves and that is the
fear of ignorance. The world's destroyer-god is
ignorance. There is no other devil on earth or in
hell below it, and this one lives, moves and has his
being in the fear of knowledge.</p>

<p>The world's saviour-god is knowledge. There is
no other Christ on earth or in any heaven above it,
and this one lives, moves and has his being in the
fear of ignorance.</p>

<p>Happily, I listened to my soul and I have found
the pearl of great price, yes, a whole bed of them, so
that I am now in position to substitute in my preaching
a truth for every lie I used to preach, and thus
save myself; but woe unto me unless I make the
substitution by ringing out the lie and ringing in the
truth.</p>

<p>Within the last three years I have learned that, as
I have not been, since the beginning of my Christian
ministry, more than a generation ago, a producer, I
have nothing of my own to give to charity, and what
is true of me is true of Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>No one is a producer who does not grow things on
the farm, make things in a shop, discover things in a
laboratory or render some necessary or helpful
service to those who do such things. I have done
nothing of the kind. If I had been preaching truths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
I might have rendered such service, but I preached
lies.</p>

<p>Every possession rightfully belongs to the productive
worker and nothing to the unproductive idler.
This is one of the two greatest and most salutary
among all the truths known to mankind. Recently I
made acknowledgment of it on the pledges to a good
cause, that of the Red Cross, by writing on their
upper left hand corners: "The gift of Unknown
Laborers through Bishop and Mrs. Brown, whose
possessions are the fruits of their enforced toil and
sacrifices."</p>

<p>By this acknowledgment I rang out a great lie&mdash;the
lie which makes the salvation of the world depend
upon the capitalists with their servants, the
preachers on the right and the politicians on the left
hand.</p>

<p>Salvation or, what is the same reality, civilization,
always has been and always will be dependent upon
the producer. It will never be attained until the laboring
class has done away with the capitalist class. The
ideal civilization (which is the salvation of the world
from its unnecessary sufferings, especially the overwhelming
ones due to the great trinity of evils, war,
poverty and slavery) is in the very nature of things
an impossibility on the basis of class sectarianism,
such as we have even in our Anglo-American
Christianity, the best interpretation of traditional religion,
and in our American democracy, the best interpretation
of traditional politics.</p>

<p>Among the pathetic things about war, there is this,
the laboring class makes by far the greater sacrifices,
not only of life and limb, but also of money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite contrary to the general impression, capitalists,
as such, pay no part of the enormous and ruinous
pecuniary cost of war. When Mr. Rockefeller pays
out three million dollars in war taxes he is disposing
of what rightfully belongs to laborers, because they,
not he, earned it. Capitalists, as such, neither earn
nor pay anything, in time of either war or peace.</p>

<p>So much for one of the two great truths. The
other, which is the greater because it includes its companion,
is this: Man has within himself all the
potentialities of his own life. This is true of the
universe as a whole, and, therefore, necessarily so of
all that therein is.</p>

<p>The sum of both truths is that the salvation of the
world is wholly dependent upon productive laborers
and that they must look individually only to the
exertion of their own mental and physical powers
and collectively to co-operation with each other for
the accomplishment of their mission.</p>

<p>Through the whole of my past ministry in the field
I rang out these great truths and rang a great lie in
by representing that the salvation of the world depends
upon a potentiality which is in the sky and not
in man, that heaven is above the earth and hell below
it, not on it.</p>

<p>When I commenced my present ministry in the
study,</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sent my Soul through the Invisible,</span>
<span class="i0">Some letter of that After-life to spell;</span>
<span class="i0">And by and by my Soul return'd to me,</span>
<span class="i0">And answer'd 'I Myself am Heaven and Hell!'</span>
</div></div>

<p>Omar, the poetic astronomer, might have added a
stanza which would have closed. "I myself am God."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
This is, in effect, what Jesus did say: "I and my
Father are one." This is as true of you and me and
of every man, woman and child as it was of Jesus.</p>

<p>And Jesus represented that God, both as Father
and Son, dwells in the hearts of believers. But every
relevant fact which has been scientifically established
as such (and there is a whole mountain of such facts)
points to the conclusion that Christians are no more
divine than other people, and that, as to his essential
nature, no man would be less divine than he is if
Jesus had never been born.</p>

<p>Gods in the skies (Jesus, Jehovah, Allah, Buddha)
are all right as subjective symbols of human
potentialities and attributes and of natural laws, even
as the Stars and Stripes on a pole, Uncle Sam in the
capitol and Santa Claus in a sleigh are all right as
such symbols; but such gods are all wrong, if regarded
as objective realities existing independently of those
who created them as divinities and placed them in celestial
habitations.</p>

<p>What is true of the gods is equally so of all the
supernaturalistic dogmas of the several traditional
interpretations of religion. Insofar as they are not
pure superstitions they are symbols of imaginary
events which people think should or must have
occurred in the past or should or must occur in the
future; not statements of historical events which have
occurred or are to occur.</p>

<p>So far I have not found it necessary to renounce
the Christian God or any of the things which go with
him and I have no idea of doing this, any more than
I have of renouncing the American Uncle Sam and
the things which go with him, but I place the Brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Jesus of the Christian religion and the Uncle Sam of
the American politics on the same footing with each
other and with others of their kind as subjective
realities. I could be a Jew and an Englishman as
conscientiously as a Christian and an American.
Many of the early Christians were also Pagans, worshippers
of other Gods than Jesus.</p>

<p>Nor is this all or even much more than half of my
religious and political levelism.</p>

<p>On the one hand as a religionist I can be any and
everything but an orthodox sectarian. This orthodoxy
is a libel against humanity. The world owes to it a
great part of all its unnecessary troubles&mdash;those which
are brought about by the triune devil of persecution,
ignorance and superstition.</p>

<p>On the other hand as a politician I can be any and
everything but a nationalistic sectarian. This
nationalism is a libel against humanity. The world
owes to it a great part of all its unnecessary troubles&mdash;those
which are brought upon it by the triune devil
of war, poverty and slavery.</p>

<p>Hoping that you will abandon Jesuine socialism for
Marxian communism and join me in an effort to banish
the fictitious, superstitious gods from the skies and
the lying, robbing capitalists from the earth, I am
with every good wish,</p>

Socialist Russia has asked for peace after every war which
the capitalist nations (England, France, Italy and America)
have waged against her, not because she could no
longer defend herself, but for the reason that her
socialism, being co-operative in its character, necessarily
imposes humaneness; yet they could not grant it, because
their capitalism, being competitive in its character, as
necessarily imposes inhumaneness. The hand of the
capitalist world is aggressively against socialist Russia,
and must be, because the life of capitalism depends upon
her death: and her hand is defensively against all the
capitalist nations. Capitalism and socialism cannot
occupy the earth together. Either the one or the other
must have all of it. Mankind in general is illustrating
the truth of the proverb which has been illustrated by
so many families in particular&mdash;a house divided against

<h3>THE GRAND MARCH</h3>

<h4>By Helen Keller</h4>


<p>The hour has struck for the Grand March! Onward, Comrades,
all together! Fall in line! Start the New Year with a
cheer! Let us join the world's procession marching toward a
glad tomorrow. Strong of hope and brave in heart the West
shall meet the East! March with us, brothers every one!
March with us to all things new! Climb with us the hills of
God to a wider, holier life. Onward, Comrades, all together,
onward to meet the Dawn!</p>

<p>Leave behind you doubts and fears! What need have we
for "ifs" and "buts"? Away with parties, schools and leagues!
Get together, keep in step, shoulder to shoulder, hearts throbbing
as one! Face the future, out-daring all you have dared!
March on, O Comrades, strong and free, out of darkness, out
of silence, out of hate and custom's deadening sway! Onward,
Comrades, all together, onward to the wind-blown Dawn!</p>

<p>With us shall go the New Day, shining behind the dark.
With us shall go Power, Knowledge, Justice, Truth. The time
is full! A new world awaits us. Its fruits, its joys, its opportunities
are ours for the taking! Fear not the hardships of the
road&mdash;the storm, the parching heat or winter's cold, hunger
or thirst or ambushed foe! There are bright lights ahead of
us, leave the shadows behind! In the East a new star is risen!
With pain and anguish the Old Order has given birth to the
New, and behold, in the East a man-child is born! Onward,
Comrades, all together! Onward to the camp-fires of Russia!
Onward to the coming Dawn!</p>

<p>Through the night of our despair rings the keen call of the
New Day. All the powers of darkness could not still that
shout of joy in far-away Moscow! Meteor-like through the
heavens flashed the golden words of light, "Soviet Republic
of Russia". Words sun-like piercing the dark, joyous radiant
love-words banishing hate, bidding the teeming world of men
to wake and live! Onward, Comrades, all together, onward to
the bright, redeeming Dawn!</p>

<p>With peace and brotherhood make sweet the bitter way of
men! Today, and all the days to come, repeat the Word of
Him who said, "Thou shall not kill". Send on psalming winds
the angel-chorus, "Peace on earth, good-will to men". Onward
march, and keep on marching until His Will on earth is
done! Onward, Comrades, all together, onward to the life-giving
fountain of Dawn!</p>

<p>All along the road beside us throng the peoples sad and
broken, weeping women, children hungry, homeless like little
birds cast out of their nest. With their hearts aflame, untamed,
glorying in martyrdom they hail us passing quickly, "Halt not,
O Comrades, yonder glimmers the star of our hope, the red-centered
dawn in the East! Halt not, lest you perish ere you
reach the Land of Promise". Onward, Comrades, all together,
onward to the sun-red Dawn!</p>

<p>The contradiction in terms known as the Christian
Socialist is inevitably antagonistic to working-class
interests and the waging of the class struggle. His
policy (that of the Christian Socialist) is the conciliation
of classes, the fraternity of robber and
robbed, not the end of classes. His avowed object,
indeed, is usually to purge the Socialist movement
of its materialism, and this means to purge it of its
Socialism and to divert it from its material aims to
the fruitless chasing of spiritual will-o'-the-wisps. A
Christian Socialist is, in fact, an anti-Socialist.</p>

<p>Clearly, then, the basis of Socialist philosophy is
utterly incompatible with religious ideas; indeed, the
latter have been reduced to their logical absurdity in
what is called "Christian Science."</p>

<p>Moreover, the consistent Christian, if such exists,
could look upon the existing world only as an
essential part of God's plan, to be accounted for only
through God, and modified at God's pleasure. He
could regard those who sought the explanation of
social conditions in purely natural causes, and who
also sought to take advantage of economic development
in order to turn this vale of tears into a pleasant
garden, only as men who denied by their acts the very
basis of his faith.</p>

<h2>CHRISTIANISM: A SUPERNATURALISTIC
OTHER-WORLDLY GOSPEL FOR THE
PASSING AGE OF CLASS INEQUALITY
AND ECONOMIC SLAVERY.</h2>

<h4>Come over and help us.<br />
Abandon Reformatory for<br />
Revolutionary Socialism.</h4>


<p>My Dear Brother:</p>

<p>Your letter (April 1st, 1920) enclosing an essay,
entitled, Is There a God, came duly to hand and I
thank you warmly for it. The essay is a masterpiece
and I hope you can let me keep this copy, or make
another for myself, for reference when I am writing
or conversing on its lines, as is frequently the case.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>In the dispute between yourself and friend of which
you speak, you are altogether right and he is entirely
wrong. In the last analysis it is a disputation as to
whether or not the Jewish-Christian bible contains
an infallible revelation from an omniscient being, a
triune god, Father, Son and Spirit. It does not.</p>

<p>As an objectivity there is no such divinity. He is a
subjectivity existing in the imagination of orthodox
Christians. You do not agree with me in this, but
every day of thought and study deepens the conviction
that it is true. None among the gods of the supernaturalistic
interpretations of religion are objectivities.
The lesser ones are generally ghosts of dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
men, and the greater ones are as generally versions of
the sun-myth.</p>

<p>The one god of the Jews and the triune god
of the Christians, if taken seriously, are superstitions;
and the bible revelations of their willings and records
of their doings, if taken literally, are lies.</p>

<p>Both the Old and New Testaments are utterly
worthless as history. The twelve patriarchs of the
Jewish God, Jehovah, are not historical personages,
but myths, and this is true of the twelve apostles of
the Christian God, Jesus.</p>

<p>Yes, the Old Testament is the Jewish version of
the immemorial and universal sun-myth, rewritten
several times for the purpose, not of telling any truth,
but of imposing the fiction that Jehovah and his people
constitute the greatest procession that ever came
down the pike of supernaturalism. The New Testament
is the Christian version of the same myth, only
with the view of showing that Jehovah and the Jews
were not, but Jesus and Christians are, this procession.</p>

<p>In itself, the sun-myth, as symbolism, is not only
poetically beautiful, but also scientifically true; yet,
as literalism, it is in the case of the ignorant, superstition,
and in the case of the educated, self-deception.</p>

<p>The sun is, in a very literal and real sense, the creator-god
in whom this world lives, moves and has its
being; and he is the saviour-god who was born of a
virgin nebula, and every winter descends into hell
and rises from the dead (the southern solstice) by a
new birth and ascends into heaven to be seated at the
right hand of the father (the sky) at the northern
solstice, and finally he is the illuminator god who
lighteth every man that cometh into the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>And the apostles who preached the gospel of the
redemption of the world are the twelve signs of the
zodiac through which the sun apparently passes in its
annual ascension to the summer solstice and descension
to the winter solstice.</p>

<p>Nor is this all: "the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sins of the world" is the sign of the zodiac, Aries
(sheep, ram) through which the sun passes towards
the end of March, when all the saviour-gods annually
died and rose again. The rising symbolizes the return
of the sun towards the northern solstice from the
southern one, upon which return seed-time and harvest
are dependent, without which the world would
perish, not indeed by sin but by starvation.</p>

<p>Jehovah is the sun-myth rewritten to fit in with the
ideals and hopes of the owning, master class of the
Jews.</p>

<p>Jesus is the sun-myth rewritten to fit in with the
ideals and hopes of the owning master class of the
Christians.</p>

<p>The Christian god, Jesus, is an improvement upon
the Jewish god, Jehovah, because of the division of
labor. The task of the owning master class is a twofold
one, the robbing of the weak owners by the strong
ones in wars, and the robbing of the slaves by the
masters which under the capitalist system is done
in surplus profits.</p>

<p>Jehovah serves Christians as the god of war. In
his name they wage wars, either as groups within a
nation having different commercial interests, as in the
case of the Civil War of the United States, or as nations
against nations with different commercial interests,
as in the case of the Revolutionary war of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Colonies with England, or the World War of the
Allied countries with the Central ones.</p>

<p>Jesus serves Christians as the god of slavery. When
they have successfully waged a war of conquest, as
the Pilgrim Fathers did against the Indians of America,
or when they have appropriated all the means and
machines of production, as the capitalists have everywhere,
they reconcile the propertyless to a terrestrial
hell of toil, want, sorrow and slavery by preaching
the Jesuine gospel of hope for a celestial heaven of
eternal rest, joy, plenty and freedom.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some for the Glories of This World; and some</span>
<span class="i0">Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come;</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum."</span>
</div> </div>

<p>In remaking the Jewish god to suit their purposes
of robbing and enslaving, the Christian owning master
class provided for a further division of his work
by creating the Holy Ghost, who devotes himself to
the giving of new revelations of the will of Jehovah
and interpreting the earlier ones as they are recorded
in the bible.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that the masters are the
strong people of the world, but they are not. Labor
is really the giant, the Samson, and it would be impossible
for the pigmy, capital, to rob him, but for his
lack of knowledge. The Holy Ghost sees to it that the
slave class is kept in ignorance.</p>

<p>The English-German, or if you prefer, the German-English
war has been an eye-opener to the giant,
labor, and capital is ruined unless he can get him to
sleep again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Capital knows that Marx was right in characterizing
the orthodox interpretations of religion, including the
Christian one, and especially it, as a sleeping potion.</p>

<p>The churches were the dormitories in which the
slaves slept through the night of the dark ages of
traditionalism, but the light of the age of scientism
is breaking upon the world and most of the slaves
have left the churches and are now beyond the reach
of their care-takers, the preachers.</p>

<p>When I wrote the Level Plan for Church Union, I
believed that the coming together of the churches
would prove to be a blessing to the world, but I am
now persuaded that it would be a curse, because the
league of churches would co-operate with the league
of nations in its robbing and enslaving schemes, the
churches doing the lying and the nations the coercing.</p>

<p>We are living in the age of scientism and, in the
case of its true sons and daughters, only scientifically
demonstrated facts count in any argumentation.</p>

<p>From the scientific point of view it is seen that there
is but one universal Kingdom of Life, Nature. This
kingdom may be divided into three, perhaps four,
states constituting the United States of Life: the mineral,
the vegetable, the animal and the human.</p>

<p>Beginning with the highest, each of these states,
except the lowest, is dependent upon the next lower.
The only independent autonomous state in the kingdom
is the mineral. This is the greatest both as to its
extent and importance. It is the common source of
every supply of all the states of life, and the seat of
each of their governments.</p>

<p>All theologians and some metaphysicians postulate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
a fifth state of life, the divine, placing it above the rest
as their source.</p>

<p>Comte, who preceded Marx as a social philosopher,
and who is the founder of modern socialism of the reformatory
type, as Marx is of the revolutionary one,
had this to say about the theologians, metaphysicians
and scientists, and he was right:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From the study of the development of human intelligence,
in all directions, and through all times, the
discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which
it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation
of proof, both in the facts of our organization
and in our historical experience. This law is this:
that each of our leading conceptions&mdash;each branch of
our knowledge&mdash;passes successively through three
different theoretical conditions: the theological, or
fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the
scientific, or positive. In other words, the human
mind, by its nature, employs in its progress three
methods of philosophizing, the character of which is
essentially different and radically opposed: viz., the
theological method, the metaphysical and the positive.
Hence arise three philosophies, or general systems
of conceptions on the aggregate of phenomena,
each of which excludes the others. The first is the
necessary point of departure of the human understanding;
the third is its fixed and definite state. The
second is merely a state of transition.</p></div>

<p>In order for a man who has reached the scientific
stage in his intellectual development to make anything
out of the reasonings of those who are still in the
stage of theological childhood or in that of metaphysical
adolescence, it is necessary for him to use their
insubstantialities as symbols of his substantialities.</p>

<p>The only difference that I can see between a theologian
and a metaphysician is that, whereas the former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
personifies a generality which is the creation of his
imagination, calling it a god, the latter objectifies a
particularity which is the creation of his imagination
calling it an entity; but all such personifications and
objectifications (gods, things-in-themselves, vital entities,
souls) are alike fictitious, because the childish
theologians and metaphysicians proceed on the basis
of philosophically assumed realities, not on scientifically
established facts which pave the way on
which an adult proceeds.</p>

<p>Comte analyzes the difference between the intellectuality
of theological children, metaphysical youths
and scientific adults as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the theological state, the human mind, seeking
the essential nature of beings, the first and final
causes (the origin and purpose) of all effects&mdash;in short,
absolute knowledge&mdash;supposes all phenomena to be
produced by the immediate action of supernatural
beings.</p>

<p>In the metaphysical state, which is only a modification
of the first, the mind supposes, instead of
supernatural beings, abstract forces, veritable entities
(that is, personified abstractions) inherent in all
beings, and capable of producing all phenomena.
What is called the explanation of phenomena is, in
this stage, a mere reference of each to its proper
entity.</p>

<p>In the final, the positive state, the mind has given
over the vain search after absolute notions, the origin
and destination of the universe, and the causes of
phenomena, and applies itself to the study of their
laws&mdash;that is, their invariable relations of succession
and resemblance. Reasoning and observation, duly
combined, are the means of this knowledge. What is
now understood when we speak of an explanation of
facts is simply the establishment of a connection be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>tween
single phenomena and some general facts the
number of which continually diminishes with the progress
of science.</p>

<p>There is no science which, having attained the positive
stage, does not bear the marks of having passed
through the others. Some time since it was (whatever
it might be now) composed, as we can now perceive,
of metaphysical abstractions: and, further back
in the course of time, it took its form from theological
conceptions. Our most advanced sciences still bear
very evident marks of the two earlier periods through
which they passed.</p>

<p>The progress of the individual mind is not only an
illustration, but an indirect evidence of that of the
general mind. The point of departure of the individual
and the race being the same, the phases of the
mind of men correspond to the epochs of the mind
of the race. How each of us is aware, if he looks back
upon his own history, that he was a theologian in his
childhood, a metaphysician in his youth and a natural
philosopher in his manhood. All men who are up to
their age can verify this for themselves.</p></div>

<p>According to the scientific classification, there are
only three kingdoms or states of life, the mineral, the
vegetable and the animal.</p>

<p>The life of the vegetable kingdom has arisen out of
the life of the mineral kingdom and is sustained by it.</p>

<p>The distinguished scientist, Professor Lowell, says,
"there is now no more reason to doubt that plants
grew out of chemical affinity than to doubt that stones
did," and nearly all outstanding zoologists would say
as much of animals.</p>

<p>Sir J. Burdon Sanderson, one of the most eminent
among biologists, insists that "in physiology the word
life is understood to mean the chemical and physical
activities of the parts of which the organism consists."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
The renowned Sir Ray Lankester strenuously holds
that "zoology is the science which seeks to arrange
and discuss the phenomena of animal life and form,
as the outcome of the operation of the laws of physics
and chemistry," and goes so far as to say that he
knows of no leading biologist who is of a different
opinion. The prince of biologists, the late Professor
Haeckel, occupied this position and impregnably fortified
it in several great books, especially in his "Riddle
of the Universe."</p>

<p>There is no force that is not life, nor life which is
not force; and there is no life or force, about which we
know anything, without a body or chemical laboratory.</p>

<p>So far as is known, there is only one life&mdash;force.
The difference between lives is a question of the organism,
the laboratory, which gives embodiment to
force.</p>

<p>The life that enables the wheels of a locomotive to
go, the sap of a tree to flow, the heart of an animal
to beat and the brain of a man to think is the same
chemical potentiality differently organized.</p>

<p>During all historical time and over all the earth,
under one name or another, the whole world has kept
days of rejoicing for life, especially Thanksgiving,
Christmas, New Year and Easter.</p>

<p>Nothing is so wonderful as life and perhaps the
greatest of its wonders is that all of it is of the same
kind.</p>

<p>Everything and every being is alive with the same
life. The Thanksgiving day sheaf of wheat, the
Christmas day Son of Man and the Easter day Son of
God (if there are conscious, personal gods and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
have sons) are alive and their life is the same, the
difference being wholly in the form and degree, not at
all in kind.</p>

<p>A proof of the oneness and sameness of all life, notwithstanding
its widely different forms and degrees,
is the fact that a bar of iron, a stick of wood, a piece
of flesh and a section of brain respond alike to the
same electrical stimulus, and all may be poisoned or
otherwise killed so that they will make no response
to it. Perhaps even a more conclusive evidence is that
the eggs (every form of both vegetable and animal
life develops from an egg) of some animals rather
high in the one tree of mundane life, which has a
common root and a stump, but two stems, the vegetable
and the animal, can be mechanically fertilized by
chemical processes.</p>

<p>Even Sir Oliver Lodge, the most conspicuous
among the comparatively few men of science who
hold to the theory that life comes to the earth as vital
entities of celestial origin and destination, makes this
fatal admission: "There is plenty of physics and chemistry
and mechanics about every vital action." On
the theory of traditional Christianity there was no
physics, chemistry or mechanics connected with the
vital actions which originally brought the universe
and all that therein was, including the earth with its
vegetable, animal and human kingdoms, into existence.</p>

<p>Every representative of each form of life in these
kingdoms (in the vegetable: a grass blade, a wheat
stalk, an oak tree; or in the animal: an insect, a horse,
a man) is a chemical laboratory for the production,
sustentation, advancement and procreation of a particular
type of one universal life. These laboratories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
have all the potentialities of their respective lives
within themselves,&mdash;no laboratory, no chemistry; no
chemistry, no life.</p>

<p>What life is, both as to its manifestation and character,
is determined by the form of organization
through which force, all there is of life, becomes a particular
and differentiated vital phenomenon. This is
as true of states and churches as it is of trees and men,
for a church or a state is a vital phenomenon as really
so as a tree or a man.</p>

<p>The trouble with every reformatory socialism of
modern times is that it undertakes the impossibility
of changing the fruit of the capitalistic state into that
of the communistic one, without changing the political
organism; but to do that is as impossible as to gather
grapes from thorns or figs from thistles. Hence an
uprooting and replanting are necessary (a revolution
not a reformation) which will give the world a new
tree of state.</p>

<p>Capitalism no longer grows the fruits (foods,
clothes and houses) which are necessary to the sustenance
of the world. Hence it encumbers the ground
and must be dug up by the roots in order that a tree
which is so organized that it will bear these necessities
may be planted in its place.</p>

<p>The people of Russia have accomplished this uprooting
and replanting (this revolution) in the case
of their state, and those of every nation are destined
to do the same in one way or another, each according
to its historical and economic development, some
perhaps with violence, most, I hope, peaceably. The
Russian Bolsheviki occupy the highest peak in man's
history; and while they stand, the world will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
be safe for industrial democracy. This democracy
is the tree of life whose fruits are for the sustenance
of the nations and whose very leaves are for their
healing.</p>

<p>The only lives of which we need know aught are
those that we shall live in our bodies by chemical
processes and in the race by conscious or unconscious
influences; for, if there is another, it will take care
of itself, if we take care of these.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, all life is on a level and since morality,
religion and Christianity are but manifestations
of it, do you not see how profoundly and incontrovertibly
true is my levelism?</p>

<p>According to this levelism all interpretations of
Christianity (protestant and catholic&mdash;congregational,
presbyterian, episcopalian and papal) and all the interpretations
of religion (Christian, Jewish, Mohammedan,
Buddhistic and the rest) are essentially on the
same footing, the difference between them being
wholly a question of natural excellencies, not at all of
supernatural uniqueness.</p>

<p>The science of biology establishes my levelism by
proving that animal and human life are on a level as
to their origin, character and destiny.</p>

<p>The science of sociology establishes my levelism
by proving that animal and human institutions are on
a level, and that therefore, there is nothing more supernatural
about a human state or church than about
an ant hill or a bee hive.</p>

<p>The science of literary criticism establishes my levelism
by proving that the bibles of the several interpretations
of religion are on a level as to their entirely
human origin and authority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The science of the comparative interpretations of
religion establishes my levelism by proving that all
the conscious, personal creator-gods, destroyer-gods,
saviour-gods and illuminator-gods, with all their
angels, heavens and hells, are so many myths&mdash;creations
of the human imagination, subjective fictions,
not objective realities.</p>

<p>Until comparatively recent times, through all the
theological history of mankind, the sun was almost
universally regarded as a god. Manifestly without it
there could be no life on earth, and its annually recurring
motions are such as to give the impression of
birth and death&mdash;of birth by ascension into the heaven
of the summer solstice&mdash;of death by descension into
the hell or grave of the winter solstice. Not only is the
sun the giver and sustainer of life, but it is also the light
that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>

<p>Modern science justifies this ancient conception as
to the dependence of the earth, and all that thereon is,
upon the sun for its being. By a slight adaptation
men of science and scientific philosophers could use
the very words of the apostle John at the opening of
his version of the Christian gospel, where he says of
Jesus, what they say of the sun:</p>

<p>All things were made by him and without him was
not anything made that was made. In him is life; and
the life is the light of men.</p>

<p>The birth, death, descension, resurrection and ascension
of all the Saviour-gods, not excepting Jesus, are
versions of the sun-myth.</p>

<p>Yet the naturalness, the universalness, the beautifulness
and withal the profound truthfulness of this
myth are such as to render it almost as undesirable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
as it is next to impossible to relegate it to the realm
of superstition, to which it should undoubtedly be
assigned if a literal interpretation is a necessity.</p>

<p>The more science advances, the more of precious
poetry and pathos, and of deep verity, too, is seen in
the Saviour-gods, who are essentially the same mythical
personifications of the glorious sun and of the
happy events of its annual career, because from it
the earth with its brother and sister planets had their
origin, and because from it the earth, not to speak of
the other planets, has the heat, light and force which
make its life a possibility.</p>

<p>There is no reason for believing that any one among
the gods of the four old supernaturalistic interpretations
of religion (Jehovah, Jesus, Allah, Buddha) or
that either of the gods of the two new interpretations
by the renowned physicist, Sir Oliver Lodge, and the
distinguished sociologist, Mr. H. G. Wells, has had
more to do in creating, sustaining and governing this
world than another, that is to say, there is no ground
for believing that the personal, conscious gods in the
skies either individually or collectively have had anything
at all to do with it.</p>

<p>Science, as it is understood by the great majority
of its exponents, teaches that the earth (with all
things, physical and psychical, which contribute to
make its world what it has been, is, and is to be) was
originally in the sun, and would quickly disappear
into its original, unorganized elements but for the sun.</p>

<p>This is as true of man as of all else. He with his
brain and its thought, with his hand and its skill;
with his homes, farms, cities, mines, shops, stores,
trains, ships, schools, hospitals and churches; with his
hate, bestiality and barbarism, and with his love, hu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>maneness
and civilization, was in the sun, billions of
years before his appearance on the earth.</p>

<p>Speaking of things appertaining to the world war:
there in the sun, before it had thrown off the earth,
were the kaiser on the throne, the president in the
white house, the millions of soldiers, the uniforms, the
rations, the forts, the cannons, guns, powder and shot,
the trenches, the barbed wire, the dreadnoughts, the
submarines, the aeroplanes, the wireless telegraph
stations, the wounded, their sufferings and groans, the
doctors and nurses, the corpses, the cripples, the
broken hearts; yes, and all the things connected with
that terrible war; the bereaved mothers, the widowed
wives, the outraged girls, the ruined country, the
wrecked cities, were in the sun from its beginning,
indeed while it was yet a nebula, many thousands of
millions of years previous to the birth of the earth.</p>

<p>If we except intruders into our solar system, such
as comets and their comparatively inconsiderable effects,
we may say that every physical or psychical
reality which at any time has entered into the history
of this planet and that of its brothers and sisters was
in that vast flowing, swirling, revolving globe of gases
which is known to have been at one time at least five
billion miles in diameter, or fifteen billions in circumference.</p>

<p>Of course no phenomenon, such as Jesus hanging
on the cross, if He lived and was crucified, was in the
sun as an actuality, but only as a potentiality. Nevertheless
He, with His doctrine and His suffering, was
there, else He would never have been anywhere, not
in the realm of history, not even in the realm of imagination.</p>

<p>The universe is ever all that it can be, and every po<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>tentiality
which contributes to make it so is within
itself. What is true in this respect of the universe as
a whole is equally so of every part of it, including man,
and especially him, because he is exceptionally capable
of controlling his own destiny, being able not only to
preserve life by a discovery of and conformity to the
laws upon which it is dependent, but also to enlarge
and enrich its content by making these laws co-operative
servants.</p>

<p>The time cannot be far off when it will be seen by
all educated, thoughtful men and women that if the
traditional, supernaturalistic interpretation of Christianity
is the only possible one, its message is not a
gospel, because its teaching touching three fundamentals
is, in each case, contrary to that of three relevant
sciences:</p>

<p>1. The sciences of astronomy, geology and biology
teach that the representation of traditional supernaturalistic
interpretation of Christianity to the effect
that the universe, including the earth with its physical
and psychical life, was supernaturally created out of
nothing by a conscious, personal god is not true and
therefore can be no part of any gospel; for, according
to the teaching of these three sciences, the truth is:
the universe with all that therein is, not excepting
mankind and civilization, was naturally evolved out
of a self-existing matter by a self-existing force co-operating
in accordance with the necessity of their
nature.</p>

<p>2. The sciences of biology, physiology and embryology
teach that the representation of the traditional,
supernaturalistic interpretation of Christianity to the
effect that man and woman are unique beings, who
have supernaturally derived their physical form, vital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and psychical potentialities directly from a conscious,
personal creator with whom are their natural affiliations,
is not true, and therefore can be no part of any
gospel; for, according to the teaching of these three
sciences, the truth is: man and woman as to their whole
beings (body and mind, life and soul) were naturally
evolved from pre-existing animal life, not supernaturally
created respectively out of the dust and a rib, so
that they owe their existence to and natural affinities
with a terrestrial and bestial parentage, not a celestial
and divine one.</p>

<p>3. The sciences of anthropology, sociology and
comparative interpretations of religion teach that the
representation of the traditional, supernaturalistic interpretation
of Christianity to the effect that man and
woman were supernaturally created in the image and
likeness of a conscious, personal god, sinless and
deathless beings with ideal environments, but that
they fell from this happy estate, through a serpentine
incarnation of a supernatural devil, and are being restored
to it, through a human incarnation of a supernatural
saviour, is not true, and therefore can be no
part of any gospel; for, according to the teaching of
these three sciences, the truth is: during many ages
man and woman, in both appearance and predilection,
were much more animal than divine and that gradually,
without any supernatural assistance, they have worked
themselves out of a state of bestial barbarism into one
of human civilization.</p>

<p>It follows therefore that the representations of both
the Old and New Testaments, concerning the origin
and history of man are largely fictitious impositions,
not historical compositions, so much so, that no confidence
can safely be reposed in any of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no rational doubt about the fictitious character
of the divine Jesus. Some think that the human
Jesus may have been an historical personage; but,
none among outstanding scholars believes that we
have a connected account of his life and work, and
most of them insist that we do not certainly know any
saying or doing of his.</p>

<p>No religious doctrine or institution of which we
have an account in the New Testament is peculiar
to Christianity and this is equally true of moral precepts.</p>

<p>The gods of all the supernaturalistic interpretations
of religion are so many creations of the dominant or
master class, and their revelations were put into their
mouths by the makers for the purpose of keeping the
slave class ignorant and contented.</p>

<p>Orthodox Christians earnestly contend that this
naturalistic doctrine makes for immorality. Heretical
socialists rationally answer that the life which men,
women and children live with reference to their terrestrial
influence, rather than to celestial rewards or
punishments, is the only one which is lived to any
moral purpose.</p>

<p>According to socialism, morality, religion and Christianity
are but synonyms of one and the same reality,
which consists wholly in the desire and effort of a
man to learn the laws or doings of nature, and to conform
his thoughts and words to them, in order to
make his present life on earth, and that of others, as
long and happy as possible, and not at all in a desire
and effort to learn what the will of a conscious, personal
god is and to conform to it, in order to avoid a
hell and gain a heaven for a future life in the sky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>If you object that this is a representation of a sceptical

<span class="i0">All are of the dust,</span>
<span class="i0">And all turn to dust again.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Darwin showed that each man in his physical development
from the embryonic cell to birth passes
through, by short cuts, the different forms of life from
say, the worm, fish and lemur with all that went before,
intervened between and followed after, and Romanes
showed that this is as true of the mind as of the
body; that, in fact, all the representatives of the animal
kingdom are physically and psychically related,
and therefore on the same level as to their origin and
destiny.</p>

<p>In his illuminating book entitled, "The Universal
Kinship," Professor Moore says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The embryonic development of a human being is
no different from the embryonic development of any
other animal. Every human being at the beginning of
his organic existence is a protozoan, about 1-125 inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
in diameter; at another stage of development he is a
tiny sac-shaped mass of cells without blood or nerves,
the gastrula; at another stage he is a worm, with a
pulsating tube instead of a heart, and without a head,
neck, spinal column, or limbs; at another stage he has
as a backbone, a rod of cartilage extending along the
back, and a faint nerve cord, as in the amphioxus, the
lowest of the vertebrates; at another stage he is a
fish with a two-chambered heart, mesonephric kidneys,
and gill-slits, with gill arteries leading to them,
just as in fishes; at another stage he is a reptile with
a three-chambered heart, and voiding his excreta
through a cloaca like other reptiles; and finally, when
he enters upon post-natal sins and actualities, he is
a sprawling, squalling, unreasoning quadruped. The
human larva from the fifth to the seventh month of
development is covered with a thick growth of hair
and has a true caudal (tail) appendage, like the
monkey. At this stage the embryo has in all thirty-eight
vertebrae, nine of which are caudal, and the
great toe extends at right angles to the other toes,
and is not longer than the other toes, but shorter, as
in the ape.</p></div>

<p>Surely no argument is needed to convince you that
Darwinism corroborates the representation of our
ancient heretical poet and scriptural preacher concerning
a life beyond the grave rather than the representations
of modern orthodox theologians.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>In history slavery stands out as a huge mountain
range traversing the whole of a continent. During<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
long ages it was supposed that these phenomena of
the human and physical worlds were due to the will
of a god (Jesus, Jehovah, Allah or Buddha) but the
vanguard of humanity has now reached a viewpoint
from which it sees that both are alike due to a law,
that a law is what nature does, not what a god has
willed, and that a system of slavery and a range of
mountains are due to the same law.</p>

<p>The matter-force law is everywhere the same, and it
is as omnipotent and immutable in a social order as in
a solar system.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The very law that moulds a tear,</span>
<span class="i0">And bids it trickle from its source,</span>
<span class="i0">That law preserves the earth a sphere,</span>
<span class="i0">And guides the planets in their course."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Most of the time, and especially just now, our world
is very full of tears, almost as much so as space is
full of spheres, but there would not be half so many
tears at any time, if the laws of states were so many
correct interpretations of the laws of nature.</p>

<p>In every age, nearly all the hot tears which deluge
the world flow, like streams of springs, from their
deep sources as the result of unnecessary suffering by
grinding poverty, by hopeless slavery, by avoidable
diseases and by premature deaths; and by far the most
of these and of all sufferings may be traced to man-made
laws which not only have no correspondence
with those of nature but are contrary to them&mdash;laws
of which both the civil codes and religious bibles are
too full.</p>

<p>You will agree with me that society should punish
none of its members by the slightest fine or shortest
imprisonment, not to speak of death, except on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
basis of justice. So far, and it is a long way, we certainly
walk together. We part company, if at all, on
the question as to the basis of justice, but come together
again in the conclusion that it is right, not
might.</p>

<p>What, then, is this right? If you answer: the law
of the state as it is interpreted by a competent court,
I reply: no legal enactment, and so, of course, no interpretation
of one, can really constitute a right, unless
it is an embodiment of a truth containing an indispensable
stone in the foundation which is necessary
to the superstructure of the ideal civilization, under
the roof of which every man, woman and child shall
possess the greatest of possible opportunities to make
life for self as long and happy as it can be, and to
help others in an ever widening circle to do this for
themselves.</p>

<p>Laws are not made. All social laws (domestic,
civil, commercial, yes, even the moral and religious
ones) are matter-force realities, as much so as is any
other among all the physical or psychical realities entering
into the constitution of the universe; which
realities are but the expressions of the processes necessarily
resulting from the necessary co-existence and
co-operation of this matter and force; therefore, laws
are so many eternal necessities and, this being the
case, it is not possible that men in states or churches
should make them, no, not even gods in heavens.</p>

<p>Man would, then, have progressed much further
with the superstructure of an ideal civilization, if only
in his efforts to rightly regulate his life, he had happily
searched out the laws of nature as they are revealed
through its phenomena and interpreted by experience
and reason, instead of looking for direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to the laws of the gods (Jehovah, Allah, Buddha or
even Jesus) as they are revealed through prophets and
interpreted by kings or presidents, by priests or
preachers and by other "powers that be of God" in
states and churches&mdash;institutions which exist in the
interest of the capitalist class and against that of the
labor class. The world owes by far the greater part
of its most poignant sufferings to this fatal mistake of
looking to gods in heavens and their representatives
on earth for direction instead of to nature and reason.</p>

<p>Life in the physical realm is dependent upon living
in harmony with the matter-force law. The representative
of any form of life (mineral, vegetable, animal,
human) which either through ignorance, accident
or willfulness does not conform to it, is destroyed or
at least injured.</p>

<p>Life in the moral part of the psychical realm consists
in a disposition and effort to learn the matter-force
law, and to fulfill in thought, word and deed the
individual obligations to self and the social obligations
to others imposed by it when it has been humanely
interpreted by a man for himself.</p>

<p>Religion and Christianity are but wider extensions
of one and the same great all-inclusive virtue, morality,
without which human life would not be worth
living, indeed not even a possibility, for without morality
a man is a beast, not a human.</p>

<p>Morality is the greatest thing in the world. Yet,
paradoxical as the representation may seem, there is
one greater thing, freedom&mdash;the liberty to think, speak
and act in accordance with one's own convictions as
to what is the law and as to what are its requirements.
Without this liberty there could be no morality, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
therefore, freedom is greater than the greatest thing in
the world, morality.</p>

<p>But liberty, the greatest and most indispensable necessity
to morality, religion and Christianity, indeed,
to the existence of a human being, is manifestly impossible
on the theory that a man must be guided by
the will of a conscious, personal God in the sky as it
is interpreted by the kings and priests, presidents and
preachers on earth.</p>

<p>You will note that I am not contending for the liberty
to live without reference to an external authority.
If this were my contention you would rightly insist
(as some among my friends do) that I am an atheist
in religion and an anarchist in politics; but I am
neither, for I recognize the fact that I must live with
reference to the existence of an external authority,
matter-force law, and there is no other, upon which
anything good in religion or politics is dependent.</p>

<p>No one is an atheist in religion, an anarchist in politics
or anything bad, who, in the physical realm of
life, tries to live with reference to the law of nature,
and who, in the moral realm of life, tries to live with
reference to a truth which is that law humanely interpreted
by himself in accordance with his own experience,
observation, investigation and reason. In the
nature of things, the interpretation cannot be by
some one else, because one man cannot live the moral
life on another's ideals any more than he can live the
physical life on another's meals.</p>

<p>Since this is the case, it follows that the whole conception
of a law which is willed by a god and revealed
or formulated by his representatives (prophets, kings,
priests, legislators) to which a man must have refer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ence,
if he would live the moral life, is, at best, a harmless
fiction and at worst a hurtful superstition.</p>

<p>There is no one (man or god) with whom people
can stand in the moral realm except themselves alone,
and if they are not within this realm they are not men
and women.</p>

<p>Manhood is dependent upon standing alone with
matter-force nature and with human reason, and it is
manhood which really counts everywhere in the social
realm, for without manhood one is nothing anywhere
in that realm.</p>

<p>Nature is my God. The gods of the several supernaturalistic
interpretations of religion (Jesus, Jehovah,
Allah, Buddha) are so many symbols of this divinity.
The words of this God are the facts of nature.
My religion and politics, worship and patriotism consist
in a desire and effort to discover these facts and
to interpret and live them humanely.</p>

<p>My God, Nature, is a triune divinity&mdash;matter being
the Father, force the Son, and law the Spirit.</p>

<p>Nature is the sum of the matter-force-law phenomena
of which the universe is constituted. Man
with his barbarism and civilization is but one among
such phenomena, on a level with the rest, as to his beginning
and ending, and as to the dependence of his
life and its fullness upon conformity to the matter-force
law, without necessary or, indeed, possible reference
to any divine-human system of laws as set
forth by a catholic or protestant church or by an imperialistic
or democratic state.</p>

<p>Unless states and churches persuade, encourage and
help man to more fully discover, more correctly interpret
and more perfectly live the matter-force law they
are worthless; and indeed worse, if in the long run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and on the whole they hinder him; and undoubtedly
they have done this in the case of the slave class&mdash;a
class which, ever since the rise of private property in
the means of producing the necessities of life, has
comprehended the vast majority of the human race.</p>

<p>Whether then man is barbarous or civilized is really
and truly, wholly and entirely a question of the knowledge
of and conformity to the matter-force law, that is,
of whether or not the articles of his religious creed and
political code are so many ideal embodiments and practical
interpretations of facts or realities as they are revealed
by the doings of my god, Nature.</p>

<p>There is no other creed, belief in the articles of which,
and there is no other code, obedience to the articles of
which, will advance mankind, individually or collectively,
so much as one step in the long, rugged and steep way
towards the goal of a perfect civilization&mdash;a civilization
which will secure to every man, woman and child the
greatest of possible opportunities to make the most of
life that is within the range of possibilities.</p>

<p>My god, Nature (the triune divinity, matter-force-motion)
the doings of which god are so many words
of the only gospel upon which the salvation of the world
is to any degree dependent, is an impersonal, unconscious,
non-moral being.</p>

<p>For me, this god, Nature, rises into personality, consciousness
and morality in myself, and in no other does
nature do this for me, though what is true of me is of
course equally so of every representative of mankind.</p>

<p>Jesus (either as an historical or dramatic personage,
and it does not matter which he was) said, "I and my
Father (god) are one," and in saying this he gave expression
in one form to the most revolutionary and salu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>tary
of all truths. The other form of the same truth as
taught by Darwin and Marx is: man has all the potentialities
of his own life within himself. Every representative
of the human race can and should say with
Jesus, "I and my Father, God, are one."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stop man! where dost thou run?</span>
<span class="i0">Heav'n lies within thy heart,</span>

</div></div>

<p>This truth constitutes the most ennobling and inspiring
part of man's knowledge, and it was naturally discovered
by him, not supernaturally revealed to him. It
is the foundation of socialism and the justification of
optimism.</p>

<p>The universe moves, with all that therein is. The
vanguard of mankind is moving to a viewpoint from
which rapidly increasing numbers will see that a
revolution which is necessary on the part of a slave to
free himself from a master is not only justified but required
by the great, first law of the biological realm,
the law of self-preservation&mdash;a nature-made law on
behalf of freedom. This nature-made law will ultimately
nullify all class laws, every law which is in
favor of the enslaving capitalist class and against
the enslaved labor class.</p>

<p>Every state with its executive, legislative, judiciary,
military and educative systems is founded on capitalism.
Since this is the case and since human nature is what it
is, all political institutions, the American with the rest,
are of the capitalist, by the capitalist, for the capitalist,
and each to the end that the capitalist may keep the laborer
in poverty and slavery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Every modern church with its ministry, bible, creed,
heaven and hell is founded on capitalism. Since this is
the case, and since human nature is what it is, all religious
institutions, the Christian with the rest, are of
the capitalist, by the capitalist, for the capitalist and
each to the end that the capitalist may keep the
laborer in ignorance and slavery.</p>

<p>Whether Jesus was an historical or a dramatic person,
the morality involved in his trial, condemnation
and execution is the same. Assuming the historicity,
he was put to death by Pilate because a class of the
people said: We have a law and by it, according to its
official interpretation, he should die. The Governor,
finding that the legal enactment and the judicial decision
were in accordance with the representation of the
Jews, turned Jesus over to the executioners for crucifixion,
and the world condemns him because he knew that
the law was the embodiment of a fiction instead of a
truth, because he interpreted it in the interest of a sect
instead of a people, and because he basely acted with
reference to his own political interests without regard
to justice for an heroic but helpless champion of slaves
in their struggle against the masters.</p>

<p>Philosophic anarchy differs by the space of the whole
heavens from practical anarchy, and it is the latter that
I always have in mind. The great essential of philosophic
anarchy is individualistic freedom. The great
essential of practical anarchy is imperialistic slavery.</p>

<p>Capitalism is the outstanding, overshadowing imperialist,
the father of all the kaisers by which the world
has been cursed, not only of the terrestrial ones such as
Wilhelm II, Nicholas II, Woodrow I, but also of the
celestial ones such as Jehovah, Allah, Buddha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The occupants of regal thrones have no more responsibility
for the existence of imperialism than those of
presidential chairs, nor they any more than I, and I have
none. The truth is that the responsibility for this blight
of all the ages is now at last, if indeed it has not always
been, wholly with the representatives of the working
class. They have the great majority in numbers and all
of the revolutionary incentives and power; therefore
they, and only they can do away with imperialism, and
they can rid themselves of it whenever they choose.
Prince Kropotkin, the philosophic anarchist, a great
soul, would agree to this representation, for he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The working men of the civilized world and their
friends in the other classes ought to induce their Governments
entirely to abandon the idea of armed intervention
in the affairs of Russia&mdash;whether open or
disguised, whether military or in the shape of subventions
to different nations.</p>

<p>Russia is now living through a revolution of the
same depth and the same importance as the British
nation underwent in 1639-1648 and France in 1789-1794;
and every nation should refuse to play the
shameful part that Great Britain, Prussia, Austria and
Russia played during the French Revolution.</p></div>

<p>Since death ends all of consciousness, the most inhuman
of all inhumanities and the most immoral of all
immoralities is the shortening of human life; and next
to it is the diminishing of its happiness.</p>

<p>War shortens many lives and fills more with misery;
hence its essential inhumanity and immorality.</p>

<p>A large part of the world has just passed through the
furnace of war&mdash;a war between the German and English
nations with their respective national allies. All international
wars are contests for supremacy in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
markets of the world, or at least for advantage in some
among them. This one was no exception.</p>

<p>The furnace of this war was seven times larger and
seven times hotter than any other has been. According
to the latest estimates (September, 1920) its fierce flames
directly and indirectly killed thirty million young men and
wrecked totally twice and partially thrice as many
more.</p>

<p>Yet the fire by which the world upon the whole and
in the long run suffers most is not the intermittent,
flaming one of the hell of international war, which is
always kindled and sustained by the capitalists of the
belligerent nations for the purpose solely of securing
commercial advantages over each other; but the greater
suffering is by the permanent, smoking fire of the hell
of the inter-class war which is always kindled and sustained
by the capitalist class in each nation for the purpose
solely of robbing the labor class of the fruit of
their toil.</p>

<p>These national and class wars (hells, flaming and
smouldering) are due to the same matter-force law,
the law of self-preservation, and, paradoxical as it may
seem, this law is equally operative on both sides in
each war.</p>

<p>Both hells exist as the result of the working out of
the same law of animal preservation by competition&mdash;the
law of capitalism, and both hells will be done away
with as the result of the working out of the same law of
human preservation by co-operation&mdash;the law of socialism.</p>

<p>One proof of the rightness of the co-operative system
is the fact that it necessarily operates for the
whole people and not for a class, whereas the competi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>tive
system as necessarily operates for a class and not
for the whole people.</p>

<p>Still another proof, and it is in itself almost if not
quite conclusive, of the rightness of the co-operative
system is the fact that its competitive rival breaks down
in every great emergency. It broke down completely in
all the belligerent countries (in none more than the
United States) immediately upon their entrance into the
world war. Our government was obliged to assume
control of the railroads, coal mines and food products.</p>

<p>If a class government, such as ours is, can provide
during a war by the co-operative system, and only by it,
for the wants of a country, and better, too, than during
the time of peace, what may we expect in the way of
plenty, comfort and leisure, when under the classless
administration there shall be no more war with its wholesale
waste, and when there shall be one vast army of
producers?</p>

<p>All the days which the fifty millions of soldiers spent
in idleness will then be so many holidays for toilers who
are in need of them for rest and self-improvement; and
every dollar which is now wasted will then be two dollars
saved, so that the pecuniary prosperity of war times
will be increased, rather than diminished, and made continuous.
Under a classless administration the world
would soon become comparatively rich and happy.<a name="Htop" id="Htop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#H">[H]</a></span></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>Representatives of the capitalist class are trying to
create the impression that the co-operative system which
our government temporarily established as a military
necessity is socialism, and that the labor class should
seek no more than its restoration and continuance: but
this system is the same old wolf in sheep's clothing.</p>

<p>The rickety house in which we are living is a competitive
structure and it cannot be made into a co-operative
one, at least not upon its present foundation,
the sand of capitalistic classism. Industrialism must
take it down and rebuild it upon the rock of classless
labor. Neither this demolition nor this reconstruction
constitutes any part of the government program. Its
socialism is a mirage, not a reality, and the matter-force
law renders it necessarily so.</p>

<p>Marxian socialism is simplicity itself. It requires only
three conditions, each of which is perfectly intelligible;
but no one of them ever has existed or could exist under
any capitalist government, because all such governments,
not excepting our own, especially not it, are organized
in the interest of parasitic profiteers, not productive laborers.
The three indispensable yet simple prerequisites
to this real socialism or communism are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>First, that the people within a municipality, either
town or city, own and control the utilities within the
area occupied by that municipality, which have to do
with the immediate comfort of the people who live
there.</p>

<p>Second, that the people in each state own and control
the utilities that come in contact with the people
on a state-wide scale.</p>

<p>Third, that the people within the nation own collectively
and control democratically the utilities
which affect us on a national scale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Should we desire to go into more detail, we might
say that the things necessary to the individual be
owned and controlled by the individual, that the home
be controlled by the family, and so on. To go into
the question on an international scale we might also
add that utilities mutually necessary to all the nations
be owned by the nations, as the Panama Canal, for
instance.&mdash;Higgins.</p></div>

<p>Prince Kropotkin, though not a bolshevik, says approvingly
of the Russian revolution that it is trying to
build up a society where the whole produce of the joint
efforts of labor by technical skill and scientific knowledge
should go entirely to the commonwealth; and he declares
that for the unavoidable reconstruction of society,
by pacific or any other revolutionary means,
there must be a union of all the trade unions of the
world to free the production of the world from its
present enslavement to capitalism.</p>

<p>Higgins and Kropotkin have here put co-operative
socialism or communism in a nutshell both as to its aim
and program.</p>

<p>The law of self-preservation is ever the same, but
whether its salvation is for a part of the people by competition&mdash;capitalist
salvation, or for the whole people
by co-operation&mdash;socialist salvation, depends upon
whether it rides or is ridden.</p>

<p>So long as the law of self-preservation was supposed
to be the will of a conscious, personal god whose earthly
representatives were kings and priests or presidents and
preachers, the law did the riding within the large domain
of animal competition&mdash;the domain of capitalism.
War is the normal, indeed necessary evil of this domain,
and hence the world must have wars so long as it remains
within it, and it will remain there so long as it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
celestial divinities with terrestrial representatives in
states and churches for its governors.</p>

<p>Now that the law is known to be a matter-force necessity,
not a divine decree, the time may rationally be
hoped for when the people will do the riding within the
small domain of human co-operation&mdash;the domain of
socialism. Peace is the normal, indeed necessary, state
of this domain, and hence the world must cease to have
war when it enters it, and is governed by itself instead
of by a god and the powers of state and church alleged
to have been ordained by him.</p>

<p>Capital punishment should not be administered, if at
all, except to a murderer whose guilt has been established
to the satisfaction of the great majority of the people in
the community to which he belongs, and never in the case
of a suspected murderer of whom this is not true.</p>

<p>If William II were really the devil behind the European
war by which many millions of the young men
of the world have lost their lives, and if Thomas Mooney
were really the devil behind the San Francisco explosion
by which ten citizens of California lost their
lives, their punishment by death might be urged with
much show of reason as a social necessity. But if
both were hung on the same gallows the world would
go on suffering by the ever recurring and closely related
misfortunes of war and riot as if nothing had
happened. The real devil behind all wars and riots is
the capitalist system. There will never be an end of
wars and riots until this devil is overthrown.</p>

<p>The so-called Kaiser-war and the so-called Mooney
riot are on the same footing, both having the character
of an insurrection and both having the aim of self-preservation.
The insurrection of the Kaiser was a riot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
on behalf of the capitalist class of Germany and for the
purpose of protecting it against the capitalist class of
England. The insurrection of Mooney (assuming his
guilt, merely for illustration) was a riot on behalf of
the labor class of California and for the purpose of
protecting it against the capitalist class of that state.</p>

<p>Incidentally, both riots have secondary aims of world-wide
extent. The Kaiser had two of these: to overthrow
the commercial supremacy of England that Germany
might have it, and to overthrow industrial republicanism
(socialism) everywhere. Mooney had this:
the overthrow of commercial imperialism (capitalism)
everywhere.</p>

<p>As rioters, there is this in common between Kaiser
William and Thomas Mooney, that though moving in
opposite directions, they are nevertheless carried by the
same matter-force law which manifests itself in the
same riotous system, capitalism&mdash;a system which, under
one form or another, has ever produced international
wars and class revolutions; and, so long as it is allowed
to exist, never will cease the production of them.</p>

<p>Hence the interests of the world require not that these
rioters, Kaiser William and Thomas Mooney, should be
hung, but that the capitalist system, which by the operation
of the law of self-preservation by animal competitions,
produced both of the riots with which they
are respectively credited, should be overthrown by the
labor system, which, by the operation of the same law
of self-preservation by human co-operation, will put an
end to all bloody conflicts.</p>

<p>But taking the popular view concerning the responsibility
for this commercial war and labor riot and assuming
that they should be charged respectively to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Kaiser William and Thomas Mooney, why should the
promoter of the little riot die, or worse, suffer imprisonment
during life, and the promoter of the big
war live?</p>

<p>Yet, if the Kaiser were captured even by England
there is no probability that he would be turned over to
a court constituted of representatives of the allied nations,
tried, found guilty and put to death. Why not?
Because, like all wars, his war, no matter which side
won the victory, has been upon the whole, or will be in
the long run, in the interest of the capitalists of every
nation on both sides, at least of the great ones.</p>

<p>If Kaiser William would not be sent to the gallows
by such a court why should the court which tried
Thomas Mooney be allowed to send him to it; and,
especially why, since California is part of a republic,
and the Kaiser's war was on behalf of imperialism and
a small minority, while Mooney's riot was on behalf of
republicanism and the overwhelming majority?</p>

<p>Just now the human part of the world is especially
afflicted by unnecessary and therefore unjustifiable
deaths. The Governor of California has the opportunity
to prevent one such death. I say to him, do it.
In the name of Justice and in the name of Humanity, I
with millions of others solemnly call upon him to save
Mooney, the revolutionist, as Pilate, the Governor of
Judea, according to the verdict of all right-thinking
men and women, should have saved Jesus, the revolutionist.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>You say in effect that we must postulate a divine consciousness
to account for human consciousness; but, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
your theory, how could human consciousness come out
of a divine consciousness; and, anyhow, contrary to your
implication, we know of no consciousness which has
come, except by inheritance, from another consciousness,
but only of consciousnesses which have come from
unconsciousnesses.</p>

<p>Your contention, in this connection, is to the effect
that nothing can come out of nothing, and this is the core
of a book, "A Short Apology for Being a Christian in
the Twentieth Century," by the learned ex-president
of Trinity College, Hartford, Dr. Williamson Smith,
with whom you have had, I think, some correspondence.</p>

<p>This Apology was written against a letter of mine to
the House of Bishops, entitled, "A Natural Gospel for
a Scientific Age," which has never seen the light, partly
because the ex-President convinced me that if I must
give up the orthodox conception of God, I could not hold
to the one which I had worked out in the letter.</p>

<p>If you have not seen the ex-President's book, you
will, I am sure, enjoy it more than I did, but I doubt
whether you will profit as much by it, for it verges towards
your lines and away from mine; and so it set me
to studying as it will not you, with the result of rejecting
the new conception of God which I had worked out for
myself, but with it I threw over the old one and ceased
to believe in the existence of a conscious, personal
divinity. Of course, my faith in the existence of a
spiritual world and hope for a future life in it went with
the god.</p>

<p>Dr. Williamson Smith and you are entirely correct
in the contention that something cannot come out of
nothing: but I no longer pretend that it can and I now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
see that the stones which have been thrown at me by
you both and others have come from glass houses; for
this is really the pretension of orthodox theologians.
They affirm that the universe was created by God out of
nothing, but produce no scrap of evidence for His existence,
and even if they could prove that He exists, they
would have to admit that He came out of nothing, or at
least from something which did so.</p>

<p>It is indeed true that I am unable to tell what matter,
force and motion came from, or if I agree with most
physicists that they arose from ether, I cannot give its
derivative; but, granting that I am as incapable of
proving their existence as you are of proving the existence
of the Christian trinity, nevertheless I have this
immense advantage over you, that I can prove that
everything both physical and psychical (including
man and his civilization) entering into the
constitution of the universe, lives, moves and
has its being in my divine trinity&mdash;matter, force and
motion: whereas you cannot prove that anything is indebted
for what it is to your divine trinity&mdash;Father, Son
and Spirit: therefore I insist that your trinity is a
symbol of mine.</p>

<p>What is true of the Christian trinity is true of all
the divinities of the supernaturalistic interpretations
of religion. The Jews live with no reference to the
Christian God, or at least not with any to his second
and third persons, and neither Christians nor Jews do
so in the case of either the Mohammedan or Buddhistic
divinity, and so on, all around the whole circle of
gods.</p>

<p>But no representative of any god lives without constant
reference to mine, of which yours and all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
others are, as I think, symbols, if they are anything
better than fetishes.</p>

<p>If you and ex-President Smith mean by your fundamental
thesis, that a thing which is essentially different
from that from which it came is an impossibility,
you are certainly wrong, for the world is full
of such things. In the tree of life there are millions
of examples, since (using language in its general significance)
everything above the amoeba must be regarded
as essentially different from it, though all, including
man, came out of it.</p>

<p>Going back as far as we safely can on solid ground,
we come to the nebulae from which the solar systems
of the universe have evolved, and surely a solar system
is as essentially different from the nebula as a
man is from an amoeba. Coming to our earth when
its primeval, flaming, swirling gases had been condensed
into inorganic matter, the protoplasm which
is organic matter, arose from it, and so something
which grows from within out, comes from something
which grows from without in.</p>

<p>The large hoofed horse came from a small five-toed
animal, not much larger than a rabbit. The piano
and the gun are brother and sister, born of the bow
and arrow, yet how different the children from the
parent.</p>

<p>An infant is unconscious at birth and what it has of
consciousness as a child and an adult is dependent
upon the development of its body.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the human body is a development
through animal bodies, we may logically conclude that
human consciousness is ultimately dependent upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and inherited from animal consciousness rather than
a divine one.</p>

<p>Jesus is represented as saying that God is a spirit;
and the fathers of the English part of the Christian
reformation said that there is but one living and true
God without body, parts or passions. This is their
explanation of his conception of God.</p>

<p>When the Jesuine definition of God and the Anglican
explanation of it were framed, the Divine Spirit
was supposed to be an objective personality.</p>

<p>Modern psychology teaches that no spirit, divine,
human or otherwise, is a personality. According to
this science, spirit and soul are synonyms for the
subjective content of a conscious life, which content
consists of feelings, aspirations, ideals, convictions and
determinations.</p>

<p>Psychologists know of no spirit or soul without a
body constituted of parts any more than physicists
know of a force without matter constituted of molecules,
atoms, electrons and ions.</p>

<p>Gods represent the religious ideals of people and
are symbols of what they think they should be as religionists.
They are symbolic, emblematic, parabolic,
allegoric devices of the imagination, and contain
nothing but the ideal, imaginary things which are
put into them by people for themselves, and they do
nothing except what the people perform through them
in their names for themselves.</p>

<p>Matter and force constitute a machine, an automatic
one, which produces things, everything which enters
into the constitution of the cosmos, by evolutionary
processes, or rather all such things, and there are no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
others, are the result of one universal and eternal
process of evolution.</p>

<p>What is known as nature is the aggregation of the
products of this machine by this process. The machine
is unconscious and its workings are mechanical,
yet some of its products rise into self-consciousness
with the power of self-determination, but both the
consciousness and the determination are limited. The
infinite consciousness, personality and determination
which are postulated of gods are contradictions.</p>

<p>Of all beings man possesses most of consciousness,
personality and determination. What he has of these
is not dependent upon gods, but all they have of them
is dependent upon him. Divine beings are, as to their
self-consciousness, personality and determination, human
beings personified and placed in the sky. Man
does everything for gods. They do nothing for him.</p>

<p>Such are the facts and arguments based upon them,
which have forced me step by step over the long way
from the position of supernaturalistic traditionalism
in its Christian form, still occupied by you, to that of
naturalistic scientism in its socialist form which I am
now occupying, as tentatively as possible, pending
further study in the light of additional facts, for which
(some six years ago, when I was desperately battling
to prevent the shipwreck of my faith in the god and
heaven of orthodox Christianity) I appealed to about
800 outstanding theologians, among them yourself,
representing all parts of christendom and every great
church, including of course all our bishops among the
theologians, and the Anglican communion among the
churches.</p>

<p>You may remember how much of correspondence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
we had at that time, though neither you nor any one
who kindly tried to reach me with the rope of the new
scientific apologetics for which I appealed, can realize
how eagerly I looked for the replies to my questions,
nor the sickness of heart which I experienced when I
saw that, in spite of every possible effort of my own
and help of others, I was slowly but surely drifting
towards what I then thought to be the fatal whirlpools
and rocks, but what I now regard as a sheltered
port&mdash;the golden gate of that delectable country,
Marxian socialism, the only heaven that I am now
hoping to behold.</p>

<p>You earnestly contend that I am wrong in representing
that the majority of outstanding men of science
and scientific philosophers do not believe in the
existence of a conscious, personal divinity, who created,
sustains and governs the universe, or in a conscious,
personal life for man beyond the grave, and
that none among such scientists and philosophers are
orthodox Christians.</p>

<p>Prof. Leuba, the Bryn Mawr psychologist, is one
among my authorities for these representations. In
his "Belief in God and Immortality" (1916) he
exhibits the results of a recent and thorough-going
investigation in a chart from which it appears that,
taking the greater and lesser representatives of the
scientists together, they fall below 50 per cent as to
their belief in God, and below 55 per cent in their belief
in immortality.<a name="Itop" id="Itop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#I">[I]</a></span></p>

<p>The showing for the scientists who are especially
concerned with the origin and destiny of life,
biologists and psychologists, is much less favorable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>to you; for, taking the greater and lesser together,
only 31 per cent of the biologists believe in God and
35 per cent in immortality; and only 25 per cent of
the psychologists believe in God, and 20 per cent in
immortality.</p>

<p>But the worst by far, is yet to come; for, taking the
greater biologists and psychologists, those who count
most, of the former 18 per cent believe in God, and
25 per cent in immortality; and of the latter, the
greatest of all authorities, only 13 per cent believe in
God, and only 8 per cent in immortality.</p>

<p>The greater psychologists are comparatively consistent
in that fewer among them believe in a conscious,
personal life for humanity beyond the grave
than in the conscious, personal life of divinity beyond
the clouds. Human immortality is an absurdity without
divine existence. The overwhelming majority of
great psychologists (the greatest of all authorities, as
to whether or not gods "without bodies, parts or
passions" can consciously exist in the skies, and disembodied
men, women and children in celestial paradises)
see this and limit the career of man to earth.
In their judgment his heaven and hell are here, and
the gods who make and the devils who unmake civilizations
are humans, not good or bad divinities.</p>

<p>This is the conclusion of a rapidly increasing number
of educated people. A century ago only a few
men of science and scientific philosophers had reached
it, not twenty five per cent, but now the percentage
is nearly ninety and it will soon be ninety-nine. The
time is coming, and in the not distant future, when no
educated man shall look to the god of any supernaturalistic
interpretation of religion for light or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
strength, and when none shall hope for a heaven above
the earth or fear a hell below it.</p>

<p>Joseph McCabe and Chapman Cohen are among the
most brilliant of present day writers on scientific and
philosophic subjects. They are not socialists, but
both see that modern socialism and orthodox
Christianism are utterly irreconcilable incompatibilities.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How is it that on the Continent democratic bodies
are so sceptical, or sceptical bodies so democratic?
Precisely because they doubt (or reject altogether)
the Christian heaven. They want to make this earth
as happy as it can be, to make sure of happiness
somewhere. Having taken their eyes from the sky,
they have discovered remarkable possibilities in the
earth. Having to give less time to God, they have
more time to give to man. They think less about
their heavenly home, and more about their earthly
home. The earthly home has grown very much
brighter for the change. The heavenly home is just
where it was.</p>

<p>"The plain truth is, of course, that the sentiment
which used to be absorbed in religion is now embodied
in humanitarianism. Religion is slowly dying everywhere.
Social idealism is growing everywhere. People
who want to persuade us that social idealism depends
on religion are puzzled by this. It is only because
they are obstinately determined to connect
everything with Christianity, in spite of its historical
record. There is no puzzle. We have transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
our emotions from God to man, from heaven to earth."&mdash;Joseph
McCabe.</p>

<p>"Socialists who have one eye on the ballot box may
assure these people that Socialism is not Atheistic,
but few will be convinced. The statement that Socialism
has nothing to do with religion, or that many
professedly religious people are Socialist, is quite
futile. A thoughtful religionist would reply that the
first point concedes the truth of all that has been said
against Socialism, while the second evades the question
at issue. No one is specially concerned with the
mental idiosyncracies of individual Socialists; what
is at issue is the question whether Socialism does or
does not take an Atheistic view of life? He might
add, too, that a Socialism which leaves out the belief
in God and a future life, which does not, in even the
remotest manner, imply these beliefs, which does not
make their acceptance the condition of holding the
meanest office in the State, and, at most, will merely
allow religious beliefs to exist so long as they do not
threaten the well-being of the State, is, to all intents
and purposes, an Atheistical system."&mdash;Chapman
Cohen.</p></div>

<p>In summing up the results of his investigations
Prof. Leuba observes that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In every class of persons investigated, the number
of believers in God is less and in most classes very
much less than the number of non-believers, and that
the number of believers in immortality is somewhat
larger than in a personal God; that among the more
distinguished, unbelief is very much more frequent
than among the less distinguished; and finally that
not only the degree of ability, but also the kind of
knowledge possessed, is significantly related to the
rejection of these beliefs.</p></div>

<p>In another connection Prof. Leuba speaking of
Christian dogmatism as a whole says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Christianity, as a system of belief, has utterly broken
down, and nothing definite, adequate, and convincing
has taken its place. There is no generally acknowledged
authority; each one believes as he can,
and few seem disturbed at being unable to hold the
tenets of the churches. This sense of freedom is the
glorious side of an otherwise dangerous situation.</p></div>

<p>Your conception of the origin, sustenance and
governance of the universe is burdened, as are all
interpretations of religion which are hinged upon the
existence of conscious, personal divinities, with two
difficulties: (1) its physical impossibility, and (2) its
moral impossibility.</p>

<p>1. Physical Impossibilities. The atomic and
molecular movements required for the thinking of a
single man would be beyond the capacity of all the
gods of the supernaturalistic interpretations of religion
together.</p>

<p>Some idea of the number of such motions which are
taking place in every human brain, will be derived
from the conservative representations of Hofmeister
as exhibited in the following condensed form by McCabe
in his book, "The Evolution of Mind:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have reason to believe that there are in each
molecule of ordinary protoplasm at least 450 atoms of
carbon, 720 atoms of hydrogen, 116 of nitrogen, 6 of
sulphur, and 140 of oxygen. Nerve-plasm is still
more complex.</p>

<p>Recent discoveries have only increased the wonder
and potentiality of the cortex. Each atom has proved
to be a remarkable constellation of electrons, a colossal
reservoir of energy. The atom of hydrogen contains
about 1,000 electrons, the atom of carbon 12,000,
the atom of nitrogen 14,000, the atom of oxygen 16,000,
and the atom of sulphur 32,000. These electrons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
circulate within the infinitesimal space of the atom
at a speed of from 10,000 to 90,000 miles a second.
It would take 340,000 barrels of powder to impart to
a bullet the speed with which some of these particles
dart out of their groups. A gramme of hydrogen&mdash;a
very tiny portion of the simplest gas&mdash;contains energy
enough to lift a million tons more than a hundred
yards.</p>

<p>Of these astounding arsenals of energy, the atoms,
we have, on the lowest computation, at least 600 million
billion in the cortex of the human brain.</p>

<p>Scientists, says Professor Olerich, in his book, "A
Modern Look at the Universe," estimate that the
chemical atom is so infinitesimally small that it requires
a group of not less than a billion to make the
group barely visible under the most powerful microscope,
and a thousand such groups would have to be
put together in order to make it just visible to the
naked eye as a mere speck floating in the sunbeam.</p>

<p>The microscope reveals innumerable animalcules in
the hundredth part of a drop of water. They all eat,
digest, move and from all appearances of their frolics,
they are endowed with sensation and ability of enjoyment.
What then shall we say of the minuteness
of the food they eat; of the blood that surges through
their veins; of their nervous system that thrills and
guides them? Their minutest organs must be composed
of molecules, atoms, ions and electrons inconceivably
smaller than are the organs themselves.</p></div>

<p>Is there any god in a celestial field who could care
for the movements which occur in the molecules constituting
a hundredth part of a drop of water, not to
speak of those which occur in the bodies of its myriads
of inhabitants? And what shall we say of all the
inorganic and organic movements in a small cup of
whole drops of water, let alone those of a great ocean
of them?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>But why go further into this subject? Is not the
utter childishness of the orthodox representative of a
supernaturalistic interpretation of religion, who
credits his god with the governance of the motions
occurring in the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms
of this globe, leaving out of account those of
its solar system, and of other systems which constitute
the universe, sufficiently manifest?</p>

<p>If you say that the motions which issue in the
phenomena of the universe are regulated by a law
which was once for all willed by the god of the
Christian interpretation of religion, I ask why the
law should be credited to the willing of this god
rather than to that of the god of Jewish, Mohammedan
or Buddhistic interpretation.</p>

<p>Newton took the first of the six initiatory steps in
the long way which led to the conclusion that the
universe is self-existing, self-sustaining and self-governing,
by showing that all the movements of the
solar systems were necessarily what they have been
by reason of a matter-force law, gravitation. This
discovery is the most momentous event in the whole
history of mankind.</p>

<p>Laplace took the second step by showing that the
cosmic nebulae contain within themselves all the
potentialities necessary to the formation of solar systems.</p>

<p>Lavoisier took the third step by showing that the
matter which enters into the constitution of the universe
is an eternality.</p>

<p>Mayer took the fourth step by showing that the
force which enters into the constitution of the universe
is an eternality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Darwin took the fifth step by showing that the
protoplasm contains all the potentialities of every
form of physical and degree of psychical life from the
moneron to man; that all representatives of both the
vegetable and animal kingdoms, including man, are
related and so on a level as to their origin and destiny,
and that the different species are the natural results
of the necessary struggle with rivals and with adverse
environments for existence.</p>

<p>Marx took the sixth step by showing that the
essential difference between humans and beasts is
primarily a question of the hand and secondarily of
the machines by which its efficiency is immeasurably
increased; that slavery has been and must continue
to be the means of advancement towards the ideal
civilization; that the kinds of human slavery were
what they have been because machines have been
what they were, and that the time is coming when
the slaves will no longer be men, women and children,
but machines which will be exploited for the good of
the many, not the profit of the few&mdash;then, and not
until then, rapid advance shall be made towards the
goal where the whole world shall be one great co-operative
family, every member of which shall have
the greatest of possible opportunities to make the
most of terrestrial life by having it as long and happy
as possible.</p>

<p>2. Moral Impossibilities. The moral impossibility
of the assumptions of these apologies is seen by all
who have eyes for seeing things as they are in the
fact that if God is credited with the good He must
also be debited with the evil. If for example, He endowed
the human body with its useful and necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
parts. He also endowed it with its harmful and unnecessary
parts.</p>

<p>Experts in the field of anatomy tell us that there
are in our bodies at least 180 useless parts, some
among which are the occasion of much suffering and
many premature deaths, the vermiform appendix
alone causing many thousands of such cases annually.</p>

<p>Do you not see that these useless structures, all of
which are inherited from the lower animals, are so
many evidences of the truth of Darwinism and the
untruthfulness of Mosaism? Eleven of these wholly
useless and more or less harmful inheritances have
been of no use to any of our ancestors from the fish
up and four are inherited from our reptilian and
amphibian forefathers, but according to Moses we
have no such progenitors.</p>

<p>Admitting the fact of the existence of evil there is
no escaping from the logical conclusions of dear, old
sensible Epicurus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Either God is willing to remove evil from this world
and cannot, or he can and is not willing, or finally he
can and is willing. If he is willing and cannot, it is
impotence, which is contrary to the nature of God.
If he can and is unwilling, it is wickedness, and that
is no less contrary to the nature of God. If he is not
willing and cannot, there is both wickedness and impotence.
If he is willing and can, which is the only
one of these suppositions that can be applied to God,
how happens it that there is evil on earth?</p></div>

<p>Oh, if only the world had been influenced by this
logic instead of by the metaphysics of the supernaturalistic
interpretations of religion, it would have
been so far on the way towards the ideal civilization
as to have long since passed the point where it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
have been possible to have the world war which has
recently deluged the earth with blood and tears, or to
make the Versailles treaty which is destined to issue in
one war after another, ever filling the world fuller with
the tyranny, poverty, slavery and misery which are the
inevitable concomitants of all wars.</p>

<p>In my opinion the fascinating essayist, Mallock,
has written the best of all apologies for theism. I
cannot imagine a better one. He, however, makes no
more attempt than Sir Oliver Lodge does to establish
Christianity, or any other supernaturalistic interpretations
of religion. Like Kant and yourself, Mallock
takes his stand on the ground that a belief in a
celestial God, and in the immortality which goes with
it, is necessary to morality, the basic virtue upon
which civilization rests. As Kant admits that the
existence of God cannot be inferred from pure reason,
so Mallock admits and even strongly contends that
it cannot be established on scientific grounds. I quote
a striking passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We must divest ourselves of all foregone conclusions,
of all question-begging reverences, and look the
facts of the universe steadily in the face.</p>

<p>If theists will but do this, what they will see will
astonish them. They will see that if there is anything
at the back of this vast process, with a consciousness
and a purpose in any way resembling our
own&mdash;a Being who knows what he wants and is doing
his best to get it&mdash;he is, instead of a holy and all-wise
God, a scatter-brained, semi-powerful, semi-impotent
monster. They will recognize as clearly as
they ever did the old familiar facts which seemed to
them evidences of God's wisdom, love and goodness;
but they will find that these facts, when taken in connection
with the others, only supply us with a stan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>dard
in the nature of this being himself by which
most of his acts are exhibited to us as those of a
criminal madman. If he had been blind, he had not
had sin; but if we maintain that he can see, then his
sin remains. Habitually a bungler as he is, and callous
when not actively cruel, we are forced to regard
him, when he seems to exhibit benevolence, as not
divinely benevolent, but merely weak and capricious,
like a boy who fondles a kitten and the next moment
sets a dog at it. And not only does his moral character
fall from him bit by bit, but his dignity disappears
also. The orderly processes of the stars and
the larger phenomena of nature are suggestive of
nothing so much as a wearisome court ceremonial
surrounding a king who is unable to understand or to
break away from it; whilst the thunder and whirlwind,
which have from time immemorial been accepted
as special revelations of his awful power and
majesty, suggest, if they suggest anything of a personal
character at all, merely some blackguardly larrikin
kicking his heels in the clouds, not perhaps bent
on mischief, but indifferent to the fact that he is causing
it.</p>

<p>But we need not attempt to fill in the picture further.
The truth is, as we consider the universe as a
whole, it fails to suggest a conscious and purposive
God at all; and it fails to do so not because the processes
of evolution as such preclude the idea that God
might have made use of them for a definite purpose,
but because when we come to consider these processes
in detail, and view them in the light of the only purposes
they suggest, we find them to be such that a
God who could deliberately have been guilty of them
would be a God too absurd, too monstrous, too mad
to be credible.</p></div>

<p>The god who had any part in bringing upon the
world the English-German war, the Versailles peace,
the Russian blockade, is for me a devil not a divinity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
If you say that the Christian god had nothing to do
with them, I reply that these are among the greatest
of all curses wherewith mankind has been afflicted in
modern times; and if he could not or would not prevent
them, what ground is there for looking to him
for help in any time of need?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How can I adequately express my contempt for the
assertion that all things occur for the best, for a wise
and beneficent end? It is the most utter falsehood,
and a crime against the human race.... Human
suffering is so great, so endless, so awful, that I can
hardly write of it.... The whole and the worst,
the worst pessimist can say is far beneath the least
particle of the truth.... Anyone who will consider
the affairs of the world at large ... will see
that they do not proceed in the manner they would
do for our happiness if a man of humane breadth of
view were placed at their head with unlimited power.
A man of intellect and humanity could cause everything
to happen in an infinitely superior manner. But
that which is ... credited to a non-existent intelligence
(or cosmic "order," it is just the same) should
really be claimed and exercised by the human race.

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>You frequently intimate that my doctrine concerning
the origin and destiny of the universe with all
that therein is, including man, is not that of the
majority of men of science and scientific philosophers,
but that yours is. It will therefore be of interest to
you to know that I have submitted the most radical
of my materialistic pieces to three men of science, all
great authorities, one of whom replied, that he was
in substantial agreement with me, but thought me to
be 400 years ahead of our time; another, that he found
nothing to criticize unless it might be my failure to
give greater prominence to the fact that the gods of
the redemptive interpretations, of religion were so
many versions of the sun-myth, and the other, that
the essay would pass any world congress of scientists
by a large majority.</p>

<p>You think that I am wrong in quoting Newton and
Darwin on my side, because they believed in the
existence of a conscious, personal god. I am persuaded
that such was not the case with Darwin at his
death; but, however this may be, it is in neither of
these cases, nor in that of any other scientist, a
question of what he philosophically believed concerning
a god, but of what he scientifically established
as a fact.</p>

<p>Newton established the fact that the movements
of the stars in their courses are naturally regulated
by the law of gravitation, not supernaturally by the
will of a god.</p>

<p>Darwin established the fact that all living species
of animal and vegetable life exist as the natural results
of evolutionary processes, not as the supernatural
results of creative acts.</p>

<p>If Newton were to stand by his theological writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ings,
he would fall in your estimation, for his work
on the book of Daniel would be regarded by you as
an absurdity. He considered Daniel to be the great
revelation of a God, Jehovah, but you know it to be
the purest fiction of a man, quite as much the work
of the imagination of its author as Don Quixote is
that of Cervantes.</p>

<p>Among the many theological authorities whom you
quote against me, the greatest, in my estimation, is
Dr. Inge, Dean of St. Paul's, London, whose utterances
I have been noting with great interest of late;
partly, no doubt, because he seems to be giving up
your orthodox side and coming over, slowly but
surely, to my heterodox one. In a London paper
which has just reached me, the Literary Guide, this
is said of the Dean:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The theological opinions of Dean Inge, one of the
official mouthpieces of the Church of England, and
probably the most distinguished spokesman for the
more liberally minded of the clergy, have now reached
an interesting stage, both for those without the
Church as well as for those within it. Although he
does not feel called upon to state his own private
conclusions on such debatable questions, he no longer
regards the doctrines of the Immaculate Conception
and the Bodily Resurrection as essential prerequisites
of Christianity and would consider fit for ordination
any candidate who rejected them, provided such
a person still acknowledged the divine nature of
Jesus Christ&mdash;that is, he would not exclude him from
the Church's ministry.</p></div>

<p>If I understand Dean Inge as he is reported in the
article of which this is the opening paragraph, he
bases his faith in the divinity of Jesus upon the
uniqueness of his character and teachings, not on the
miraculousness of his birth and healings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>But Dean Inge has no authentic or reliable account
of the life and teachings of Jesus; and so, as a
theologian, like all theologians, he lives, moves and
has his being in the realm of fiction, the difference between
him and yourself being that he is in that part
of it where the imagination sits enthroned, and you
in the region where metaphysics is monarch of all it
surveys.</p>

<p>An outstanding theologian who, as it seems to me,
overshadows Dean Inge, commenting upon a piece
of my writing which is quite as radical as any part
of this letter goes even further than he.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have," he says, "just read the Chapter of your
Natural Gospel for a Scientific Age, which you have
kindly sent me, with the greatest interest. Indeed I
have come so heartily to share your point of view
that I can find no points for criticism; I can only say
how grateful I am to have had an opportunity of seeing
your uncompromising and clear expression of the
only kind of Modernism that has any promise for the
future. I am beginning to feel more and more uncomfortable
in our Christian movement because so
many of our leaders here are attempting an impossible
compromise with dogma. Men like Dr. Rashdall have
no place in the movement for men who cannot accept
their 'fullblooded theism.' In fact they are
Harnackians with their one or two unalterably fixed
dogmas."</p></div>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>If you ask why I continue to be a member of an
orthodox church and its ministry, the answer is, there
is no reason why I should not for (if they may be interpreted
by myself, for myself, spiritually) I accept
every article of the creed of catholic orthodoxy; but if
the articles of this creed must be interpreted lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>erally
there is no one in our church (the Episcopal)
or in any among the churches, who believes
all of them. For example, who believes, that God
created the heavens and the earth out of nothing
in six days, as he is represented to have done
in his alleged revelation of which the creed is a condensation?
All in this church, or at least all the
ministers of it, who have obeyed its requirement respecting
the devotion of themselves to study, as I
have, know that the firmament or heaven of which
the revelation speaks has no substantial existence,
only an imaginary one. What was supposed to be
it, is but the reflection of light upon the dust of the
atmosphere. As for the earth it was not made out
of nothing; and, indeed, it was not supernaturally
made at all but naturally evolutionized out of matter
and force, and even they were not created by a god,
for they are co-existing eternalities; nor were their
evolutionary processes directed by him, for they have
eternally, automatically and necessarily co-operated
in such processes to the production of every
phenomenon which has contributed to make both
the physical and psychical parts of the universe what
they have been at any time, including the divine,
diabolical and angelic fictions which men have made
and placed above and below the earth.</p>

<p>If you ask whether I am still a professing Christian,
I will answer: yes, yet the Brother Jesus of the New
Testament, catholic creed and protestant confessions,
is not for me an historical personage, but only a
symbol of all that is for the good of the world, even as
the Uncle Sam of American literature is not an historical
personage but only a symbol of all which is
for the good of the United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>If you ask whether I am a praying Christian, I
shall answer: yes, yet when I pray, as I do every
day, my prayer is an appeal to a real divinity within
my heart, the better self, of which self all the unreal
divinities in the skies including the Christian trinity,
Father, Son and Spirit, are but poetic symbols, and I
no longer expect this God to answer otherwise than
the symbol of parents, Santa Claus, answers the
prayers of children, or the symbol of the United States,
Uncle Sam, answers the prayers of Americans.</p>

<p>If you ask whether I am a communing Christian, I
shall answer: yes, yet when I go to the Lord's Supper,
as I do every month, the strength which I receive is
derived from the feeling that through it I place myself
in communion with my human brethren on earth, not
with a divine brother in the sky, particularly with the
members of my church and the citizens of my town
and its neighborhood, but generally with all men,
women and children throughout the whole world, of
which real brethren the brother god in the sky, Jesus,
is but a poetic symbol; nor do I now regard the
communion of this supper as being essentially
different from that of any ordinary family-meal,
lodge-banquet, or socialist-picnic, with each of which
repasts the informal Lord's Supper of the apostolic
church had much more in common than it has with
the formal celebrations of the sacrament in any among
the sectarian churches.<a name="Jtop" id="Jtop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#J">[J]</a></span></p>

<p>Many critics represent that, in view of the changes
in my theological opinion, if I am an honest man, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>a hypocrite, I will leave the ministry and communion
of the Episcopal Church. But why should I go while
any of my brother clergymen remain? I give a
symbolic or allegorical interpretation to every article
of the whole system of Christian supernaturalism and
uniqueism; yet as symbols, allegories, parables, or
myths, I do not reject any, and no member of our
House of Bishops literally accepts all.</p>

<p>Who among influential preachers of any rank in
any church believes: (1) that the world was made
about six thousand years ago by a personal, Creator-God
out of nothing; or that it was made at any time
out of anything? (2) that such a God formed Adam
out of dust and Eve out of a rib; that they left His
hands as perfect physical and moral images of Himself,
and fully civilized representatives of the human
race; or that there was any first man and woman?
(3) that He planted a Garden of Eden and placed
them therein under ideal conditions, and that He
walked in it and talked with them; or that there ever
was any such garden? (4) that a personal destroyer-Devil,
incarnated in a talking serpent, tempted them
into disobedience; or that there ever was any such
Devil? (5) that but for this Devil's influence and
their sin, labor and suffering, physical death and moral
degradation would have been unknown on earth, and
that it would have been the permanent abode of mankind,
as indeed of all sentient creatures; or that any
of the higher forms of life would have been possible
without death? and (6) that to repair the evils accomplished
by this Destroyer-Devil it was necessary
for a personal Restorer-God to become incarnated in
a man, in order that he might shed this blood as a
sufficient sacrifice for the satisfaction of the offended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Creator-God; also, in order that the resurrection of
the bodies (bones, flesh, blood and animal organism)
of all deceased men, women and children and the
rehabitation of them by their respective souls could be
accomplished, to the end that a few, on account of their
faith, might be transferred to a permanent home in a
heaven on a firmament above the earth, and the many,
because of their lack of faith, to a permanent home in
a hell below; or that there ever was any such incarnation
for these purposes; or that there are any
such firmament, heaven, and hell, or that there will
be any such resurrection, ascension or descension?</p>

<p>If other bishops, priests and deacons can, as they must,
bring in their symbolism or allegorism touching any or
all of these six fundamentals, which constitute the basis
of the supernaturalism of traditional Christianity, and
yet not leave the church, why may not I bring in mine
and remain?</p>

<p>Attention is called by several critics to Sir Oliver
Lodge, as an example of an outstanding man of
science who accepts supernaturalism. While I was
desperately trying to retain my conception of a supernaturalistic
God and of all the supernaturalism that
goes with it (revelation of truth, answer to prayer,
guidance by providence, resurrection of the dead and
their ascension, eternal consciousness and happiness)
I at one time centered a great deal of hope in him,
and eagerly studied his works as indeed I did those of
most apologists for supernaturalism among them the
greatest, Flammarion, Balfour, Bergson and Hudson,
but my careful study of his many writings convinced
me that he does not hold any of the supernaturalistic
doctrines which are distinctively Christian.</p>

<p>However, it is my doctrine concerning Jesus, rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
than that of Christian traditionalism, that is in exact
alignment with that of this renowned physicist. We
agree that Jesus, if historical, was a Son of God and
the Christ to men in no other sense, and therefore in
no higher degree, than all representatives of the
human race may be sons or daughters of God, if there
are gods and christs, to the men, women and children
with whom they come in contact.</p>

<p>Most critics think that I am wrong in representing
that the great majority of the leading men of science
are naturalistic, not supernaturalistic, but Sir Oliver
Lodge represents that among such scientists it is
generally believed that the universe is "self-explained,
self-contained and self-maintained;" and speaking on
his own behalf of its creation out of nothing he says:
"The improbability or absurdity of such a conception,
except in the symbolism of poetry, is extreme, and
it is unthinkable by any educated person."</p>

<p>All these gods were created, endowed and located
by man, and then he had them make revelations,
create churches, institute sacraments and appoint
priesthoods for his redemption from devils whom he
also created, endowed and located.</p>

<p>This is why people of the same country and time
have such different gods and revelations. Jehovah is
the god and the Old Testament the revelation of the
kings and plutocrats who are responsible for wars;
Jesus is the god and the New Testament is the
revelation of the doctors and nurses who do what
they can to alleviate the misery of them.</p>

<p>The gods, not excepting Jehovah and Jesus, are as
mythical as Santa Claus and answer their suppliants
not otherwise than he answers his, through human
representatives. If the suffering, needy or afflicted do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
not get help and sympathy from men, women and
children they get none from the gods and angels.</p>

<p>While on the one hand the great majority of
scientists, scientific philosophers and educated people
generally doubt that any god ever answered a prayer
or exercised a providence, on the other, no one doubts
that men, women and children answer millions of
prayers daily and that every person's career is wholly
different from what it would have been but for human
providence; that, indeed, life would be impossible
without the providence which all people exercise in
the hearing and answering of prayers.</p>

<p>Representatives of many of the interpretations of
religion strewed every battle-field of the European
war. The celestial saviours did not care for one of
their devotees. The terrestrial saviours (doctors and
nurses) did everything for the desperately wounded
and saved millions who would have miserably perished
but for them. These were the real christs and angels
of whom the celestial ones are but symbols. The
celestials always have passed by on the other side.
The terrestrials are the Good Samaritans when there
are any.</p>

<p>Sceptics infer from this negligence that the gods
and angels have no real objective existence. Believers
contend that they really exist objectively and excuse
the neglect on account of preoccupation. For example,
the God of traditional Christianity is supposed to
spend much time counting hairs on the heads of His
people and watching sparrows fall to the ground.
Sceptics are reverently but earnestly asking: Why
does He not keep the sparrows from falling? Why
does He not let the hairs remain unnumbered, until
He has put a stop to wars and promoted good will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
among men to a degree which will render it impossible
that the world should any longer be cursed
by them?</p>

<p>If believers say that we have no knowledge of the
ways of God, sceptics reply: Since all which is known
about any objective reality is concerning the ways
thereof, what the action is under given circumstances,
how do you know that your God has anything to do
with either sparrows or men, or even that He exists?</p>

<p>As to their philosophy concerning the origin,
sustenance and governance of the universe, socialists
of the school of Marx, are almost to a man
materialists; but, as to their philosophy concerning
life, they are as generally idealists. There is, I feel
sure, as much idealism in my thinking and living now
as there was in the days of my orthodoxy, but I will
let you judge for yourself after reading the following
confession of faith:</p>

<p>My early life was blighted as the result of the
premature death of my father by the Civil War and
the consequent breaking up of his family and my
bondage to a German who made a slave of me, broke
my health by overwork and exposure, and, worst of
all, kept me in ignorance, so that when, at the age
of twenty-one, I began my education, I was assigned
to the fourth grade of a public school.</p>

<p>The prime of my life has been wasted in preaching
as truths the dogmas of the Christian theology, the
representations of which I now believe, with the overwhelming
majority of educated people, to be at best
so many symbols and at worst superstitions.</p>

<p>But though I do not now and probably never shall
again believe in the existence of a conscious, personal
god, a knowledge of and obedience to whose will is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
necessary to salvation, yet an injustice is done me
by those who say I have abandoned god and religion.</p>

<p>Every one who desires and endeavors to fulfill the
requirements of a law which is independent of his
will and beyond his control has a god and a religion.
I desire and endeavor this in the case of two such
laws and so have two gods and two religions. Both
of my divinities are trinities. One is in the physical
realm and the other in the moral one.</p>

<p>In the physical realm my triune god is: matter, the
father; force, the son, and motion, the spirit.</p>

<p>In the moral realm, my triune god is: fact, the father;
truth, the son, and life, the spirit.</p>

<p>For me the triune divinity of Christianity is a
symbol of these trinities and it is my desire and effort
to discover and fulfill what they require of me, in
order that I may make my own physical, psychical
and moral life as long, happy and complete as possible
and help others in doing this for themselves. This
desire and effort is at once my morality and religion,
my politics and patriotism, and they are spiritual
realities.</p>

<p>On account of the first of these sets of spiritual
virtues (morality and religion) I claim to be a
Christian of the highest type, and that any accusation
which is raised against me because of alleged disloyalty
to any essential of Christianism is an injustice.</p>

<p>On account of the second of these sets of spiritual
virtues (politics and patriotism) I claim to be an
American of the highest type, and that any accusation
which is raised against me because of alleged disloyalty
to an essential of Americanism is an injustice.</p>

<p>From the viewpoint of the self-styled one hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
per cent Christians, I am a betrayer of Brother Jesus
because I do not believe that he ever had any
existence as a god and that, if he was at any time a
man, the world does not now and never can know of
one thing that he did or of one word that he said.</p>

<p>From the viewpoint of the self-styled one hundred
per cent Americans, I am a traitor to Uncle Sam, because
I did oppose his going into the English-German
war, and because I do object to the partiality which
he shows to his rich nephews and nieces.</p>

<p>Still Jesus and Uncle Sam are as dear to me as ever
and indeed dearer, yet not as objective, conscious personalities,
but as symbols, ideals or patterns.</p>

<p>However, though I love my Brother Jesus and
Uncle Sam all the time, as a child does Santa Claus
at Christmas time, I am no longer childish enough
at any time to look to either of them to do anything
for me, because I know that what is done for me must
be done either by myself or by men, women and
children, and that as objective, conscious personalities,
my Brother Jesus and Uncle Sam have had no more
to do with my life than the man-in-the-moon.</p>

<p>Your observation concerning the American government
as being the standard to which all governments
will ultimately conform challenges an earnest word
of friendly dissent.</p>

<p>Our government is what all the governments of the
world are (with the single exception of the Russian)
a government in the interest of a small class, the
representatives of which own the means and machines
of production and distribution and who produce and
distribute things for profit, each for himself.</p>

<p>The representatives of one class produce things
socially, and those of another class appropriate them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
individually. This is capitalistic anarchy, the worst
of possible anarchism, and it must have an end soon
or the world will be lost.</p>

<p>Robbery is the essence of anarchy and Marx showed
that every cent of profit made under the existing system
of economics (and in the United States it amounts
to several billions of dollars every year) is so much
robbery of the many who make and operate the
machines, because they are paid less in wages than
the value of the products made and distributed by
them.</p>

<p>We are hearing much in these days about the
anarchy of those who are dissatisfied with the
capitalistic governments, but the governments themselves
and those in whose interests they exist are the
real anarchists. The flesh and blood of anarchism
are robbery and lying, and these are the meat and
drink of capitalism.</p>

<p>The English-German war was the most flagrant
act of anarchy in the whole history of mankind. The
peace of Versailles and the blockade of Russia were
outrageous acts of anarchy, and so also are the
terrorism and tyranny of which every capitalistic
country is so full, our own with the rest.</p>

<p>Morality is the very heart of civilization and of all
that really makes for it; but morality is impossible
on a capitalistic basis, for it is founded on the most
immoral things in the world, robbery, lying, murder,
ignorance, poverty and slavery.</p>

<p>If I am right in the conviction that the United
States is more wholly given over to capitalism than
any other nation, not excepting even England, it is
the greatest robber, liar and murderer on earth. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
then, can the United States become the standard for
the governments of the nations?</p>

<p>If the government of Russia holds its own, it, rather
than that of the United States, will become the
standard to which all governments must measure up
or else go down.</p>

<p>Yes, not the government of the United States but
that of Russia is destined to become the standard of
all peoples, for the aim of our government is money,
more money, and then some, for the few, while the
infinitely higher aim of theirs is life, more life, fuller
life for every man, woman and child.</p>

<p>Within my generation the vanguard of humanity
has passed from the age of traditionalism to that of
scientism and this transition is the greatest and most
salutary event in the whole history of humanity. It
is impossible to exaggerate its importance. It marks
the time when man began consciously to realize that
he must look to himself rather than to any god for
salvation.</p>

<p>From time immemorial man has realized that
ignorance is his ruin and knowledge his salvation,
but during the too many and too long ages of
traditionalism he made the fatal mistake of supposing
that he was dependent upon a supernatural revelation
by an unconscious, personal god for the necessary
knowledge. But now the leading people of the world,
the shepherds of the sheep, are seeing with increasing
clearness that man has naturally inherited his knowledge
and must naturally acquire by his own
experience, reason and investigation every addition
to it.</p>

<p>The world is indeed passing through a long, dark
night, but neither the longest nor the darkest, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
since at last a great and rapidly increasing multitude
happily realize that humanity must work out its own
salvation through the living of its own knowledge
by its own inherited and increased strength, not
by a supernatural grace, we of this generation may
rationally hope, as those of no other did or could, for
the dawning of the longest and brightest of all days.</p>

<p>As an old year dies into a new one, and as flourishing
generations die into rising ones, so the old
traditional ages, when nations and sects looked to
their rival gods in the skies for help, are happily
dying into the new scientific age, when all sensible
and good men, relying upon the strength of a common
divinity which is within themselves, will unite
in an all-inclusive brotherhood for the promotion of
the ideal civilization, a universal reign of righteousness.</p>

<p>It is night,&mdash;midnight. The clock is striking twelve.
But this is the very hour and the very minute, when
all the saviours of mankind have always been and
ever will be born. Then it is that the Virgin, Nature,
comes to this dark world with her new born Son,
Truth, whom to know and follow is morality, religion,
politics and life. It is then that those who give
expression to the highest ideals and deepest longings
of mankind, hear the angels, Reason and Hope, sing:
On earth peace and good will towards men.</p>

<h3><a name="I_SCIENTIFIC_SOCIALISM" id="I_SCIENTIFIC_SOCIALISM"></a>I. SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM.</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The working class and the employing class have nothing
in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger
and want are found among millions of working
people and the few, who make up the employing class,
have all the good things of life.</p>

<p>Between these two classes a struggle must go on until
the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession
of the earth and the machinery of production, and
abolish the wage system.</p>

<p>We find that the centering of management of the industries
into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions
unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing
class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs
which allows one set of workers to be pitted against
another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping
defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the
trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the
workers into the belief that the working class have interests
in common with their employers.</p>

<p>These conditions can be changed and the interest of
the working class upheld only by an organization formed
in such a way that all its members in any one industry,
or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a
strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus
making an injury to one an injury to all.</p>

<p>Instead of the conservative motto, "A fair day's wage
for a fair day's work", we must inscribe on our banner
the revolutionary watchword, "Abolition of the wage
system".</p>

<p>It is the historic mission of the working class to do
away with capitalism. The army of production must be
organized, not only for the every-day struggle with capitalists,
but also to carry on production when capitalism
shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially
we are forming the structure of the new society within
the shell of the old.&mdash;Preamble of the Industrial Workers
of the World.</p></div>

<p>The following Synopsis of Scientific Socialism will
serve both as a summary of and supplement to my
little book. It is the introductory part of a catechism
(a series of questions and answers) entitled "Scientific
Socialism Study Course" published by Charles H.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Kerr &amp; Company, 341 East Ohio Street, Chicago, and
is reprinted here by their consent, with certain changes
in the interests of brevity and perspicuity. As a
whole this short Study Course of only thirty small
pages in large type is the greatest piece of catechetical
literature of which I have any knowledge. Even the
synopsis as given here contains more of the education
which makes for the good of the world than all
the catechisms of all the churches. The Catechism
was published in 1913.</p>

<p>1. How do you explain the phenomena of History?</p>

<p>Ans.: History, from the capitalist point of view,
is a record of political and intellectual changes and
revolutions of so-called great men, wherein the
economic causes for these acts and changes are ignored
or concealed; but, from the socialist view point, history
reveals a series of class struggles between an exploited
wealth-producing class and an exploiting ruling
class over the wealth produced.</p>

<p>2. What effect have "great men" had on history?</p>

<p>Ans.: Great men were simply ideal expressions of
the hopes of some class in society that was becoming
economically powerful. They formed a nucleus
around which a class gathered itself in attaining
economic conquests in its own interest, and in establishing
social institutions in harmony with, and for the
perpetuation of, such class interests. These men had
to embody some vital principles from the economic
conditions of their time and represent some class interest.
The same men with the same ideas would not
be great men under a different mode of production
when the time for their ideas was not ripe.</p>

<p>3. What great factor is responsible for the rise of
"great men?"</p>

<p>Ans.: The fact that the ideas of these men coincided
with the class interests of some class in society
that was becoming economically powerful. Therefore
economic conditions must exist or be developing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
which find their highest expression in the ideas of
such men.</p>

<p>4. Why do social institutions change and not remain
fixed?</p>

<p>Ans.: Because the process of economic evolution
will not permit them to remain fixed. The development
and improvement of the means of production and
distribution produce economic changes, therefore social
institutions (the state, church, school and even the
family) are forced to change to conform with changing
economic conditions. These are due to evolutionary
and revolutionary processes connected with the
means of production and distribution.</p>

<p>5. What is responsible for the birth of new ideas,
and do they occur to some one individual only?</p>

<p>Ans.: New ideas, theories and discoveries emanate
from material conditions, and such conditions act
upon individuals. The same idea or discovery may be
brought out by different individuals independently
and apart from each other. This proves that it is not
great men who are responsible for material conditions,
but that material conditions (modes of production
and distribution) produce the men best able to marshal
the facts and express the idea; usually in the interest
of some class.</p>

<p>6. What single great idea occurred to both Darwin
and Wallace independently?</p>

<p>Ans.: The theory of "Natural Selection" which
showed that the closely allied ante-type was the parent
stock from which the new form had been derived
by variation.</p>

<p>7. What single great idea occurred to both Marx
and Engels independently?</p>

<p>Ans.: The "Materialistic Conception of History."</p>

<p>8. Name the three great ideas developed by Marx
and Engels which now form the bed-rock basis for the
socialist philosophy.</p>

<p>Ans.: (1) the Materialistic Conception of History,
or, the law of economic determinism, (2) the Law of
Surplus Value, and (3) the Class Struggle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Explain, briefly, the "materialistic conception
of history."</p>

<p>Ans.: "In every historical epoch, the prevailing
mode of economic production and exchange and the
social organization necessarily following from it
forms the basis upon which is built up and from which
alone can be explained, the political and intellectual
history of that epoch." The laws, customs, education,
religion, public opinion and morals are in the long
run controlled and shaped by economic conditions;
or, in other words, by the dominant ruling class which
the economic system of any given period forces to the
front.</p>

<p>10. What is the most important question in life?</p>

<p>Ans.: The problem of securing food and shelter.</p>

<p>11. What bearing does this have on the materialistic
conception of history?</p>

<p>Ans.: It gives us the only key by which we can
understand the history of the past, and within limits,
predict the course of future development.</p>

<p>12. What effect does the prevailing mode of production
and exchange in any particular epoch, have
on the social organization and political and intellectual
history of that epoch?</p>

<p>Ans.: "Anything that goes to the roots of the
economic structure and modifies it (the food and
shelter question in life) will inevitably modify every
other branch and department of human life, political,
ethical, religious and moral. This makes the social
question primarily an economic one and all our
thought and effort should be concentrated on it."</p>

<p>13. Do the ideas of the ruling class, in any given
epoch, correspond with the prevailing mode of economic
production?</p>

<p>Ans.: They correspond exactly, as all connective
institutions, civil, religious, legal, educational, political
and domestic have been moulded in the interest
of the economically dominant class who control these
institutions in a manner to uphold their class interests
where their ideas find expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>14. What effect do these ideas of the ruling class
have on the interests of the subject class?</p>

<p>Ans.: The effect is detrimental to the interests of
the subject class as the different class interests conflict.
Therefore the ruling class finds the institutions
mentioned very useful in either persuading or forcing
the so-called "lower classes" to submit to the economic
conditions that are absolutely against their interest,
even though they are the wealth producing class.</p>

<p>15. Distinguish natural environment from man-made
environment.</p>

<p>Ans.: Natural environment which consisted of the
fertility of the soil, climatic conditions, abundance of
fruits, nuts, game and fish was all-important in the
early stage of man's development. With the progress
of civilization this nature-made environment loses its
supreme importance and the man-made economic environment
becomes equally important.</p>

<p>16. Explain, briefly, the law of Surplus Value.</p>

<p>Ans.: It is the difference between what the working
class as a whole gets for its labor power at its
value in wages, say an average of five dollars per day,
for producing commodities, and what the employing
class as a whole gets, say an average of twenty-five
dollars, for the same commodities when sold at their
value. According to this conservative estimate capital
is upon the whole and in the long run robbing
labor of four-fifths of the value of its productive power.
Capitalism is therefore the great robber, the Beelzebub
of robbers.</p>

<p>17. Since the economic factor is the determining
factor, what does the law of Surplus Value furnish
us?</p>

<p>Ans.: "Surplus Value is the key to the whole present
economic organization of society. The end and
object of capitalist society is the formation and accumulation
of surplus value; or in other words, the
systematic, legal robbery of the subject working
class."</p>

<p>18. Define value and state how measured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Ans.: Value is the average amount of human labor
time socially, not individually, necessary under
average, not special, conditions for the production or
reproduction of commodities.</p>

<p>19. What determines the value of labor power?</p>

<p>Ans.: It is determined precisely like the value of
every other commodity, i. e., by the amount of labor
time socially necessary for its production or reproduction
by the raising and support of children to succeed
their parents as wage-earning slaves.</p>

<p>20. Since labor power is a commodity, what condition
is it subject to?</p>

<p>Ans.: It is subject to the same conditions that all
other commodities are subject to without regard to
the fact that it is the source of all social value. The
worker in whom the commodity labor power is embodied,
does not get the value of the product of his
labor, but only about one-fifth of it, enough to keep
him in working order and reproduce more labor
power in his children. If the worker received the
value of the product of his labor he would receive much
more than enough to keep him in working order and
to raise his family. Such an economic condition would
abolish all forms of surplus value or profit, also the
wage system, by substituting economic and social organization
in the interest of the working class. No
other class could remain in existence and the class
struggle would be ended.</p>

<p>21. In what economic system, past or present, does
surplus value appear?</p>

<p>Ans.: It is the root of all social systems since the rise
of the institution of private property, but only under the
present system (capitalism) has labor power assumed
the commodity form. Labor power is a commodity with
a two fold character: it has a use and an exchange value.
Its use value consists in its being capable of producing
values over and above its own needs for sustenance and
reproduction. Its exchange value consists in the amount
of socially necessary labor time required for its production
and reproduction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The chattel and feudal systems of slavery were not
directly concerned with the production of commodities
for the profit of the masters, but rather with the producing
of the necessities of life for all, masters and
slaves, and the luxuries for some, the masters. That
which was not produced for immediate consumption
was sold, if opportunities presented themselves, and
occasionally the professional traders developed, for
example, the Phoenicians; but they were an exception
to the rule. The same holds good for feudalism, except
that during the latter stages of that system commercialism
arose; but this commercialism was no feature
of feudalism&mdash;it was the rising capitalism that began
to unfold and assert itself.</p>

<p>22. Name the three great systems of economic organization
upon which the structure of past history
and social institutions have their basis.</p>

<p>Ans.: (1) Chattel slavery, (2) serfdom, or feudal
slavery and (3) wage slavery.</p>

<p>23. Explain, briefly, how the subject class was exploited
under each of these economic systems.</p>

<p>Ans.: 1. Under chattel slavery the laborer was a chattel
(possession or property) the same as a mule or horse,
and only received his "keep," that is, enough food, clothing
and shelter to keep him in working order and to
reproduce labor power by raising children. All he
produced (use values and children) was taken by his
master. The body of the slave was the property of
his master. 2. Under serfdom or feudal slavery, the
worker produced what was necessary to keep him in
working order and to raise a family of slaves, and
then the balance of his time produced use values for
his feudal lord. The body of the slave was his own,
though he could not go about with it from one place
to another; for it was bound to the land of his master.
3. Under the wage slavery, the worker receives wages
which again equals only the amount necessary to keep
him in working order and to reproduce more labor
power in his children. His entire product belongs to
the capitalist, and out of this resource he pays the wages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
for the commodity labor, also for other commodities
such as raw materials, and appropriates all of the balance
and converts it into capital with which he not only continues
but increases the exploitation of his workers. The
body of the capitalist's slave is indeed his own as under
the feudal system but with this difference, that if he does
not like his master, or he is disliked by him, he can
or must go abroad with it from one place to another
looking for a job&mdash;a liberty or necessity which is to
the advantage of the owning class and the disadvantage
of the working class. Unemployment is necessary
to the existence of capitalism, but this necessity is a
danger to the system and will ultimately destroy it in all
countries as it has in Russia.</p>

<p>24. Define the "Class Struggle."</p>

<p>Ans.: It is the direct clash between two hostile
class interests wherein the employing class makes
every effort to appropriate more of the wealth produced
by the working class, and the working class ever
struggles to retain more of the wealth which it produces.
The capitalist class strives to get more surplus
value and the working class strives to get more wages.</p>

<p>The class consciousness of those who live by working
has found one of its best expressions in the following
paragraphs:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The world stands upon the threshold of a new social
order. The capitalist system of production and distribution
is doomed; capitalist appropriation of labor's
product forces the bulk of mankind into wage slavery,
throws society into the convulsions of the class struggle,
and momentarily threatens to engulf humanity in chaos
and disaster.</p>

<p>Since the advent of civilization human society has
been divided into classes. Each new form of society has
come into being with a definite purpose to fulfill in the
progress of the human race. Each has been born, has
grown, developed, prospered, become old, outworn, and,
has finally been overthrown. Each society has developed
within itself the germs of its own destruction as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
as the germs which went to make up the society of the
future.</p>

<p>The capitalist system rose during the seventeenth,
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by the overthrow of
feudalism. Its great and all-important mission in the
development of man was to improve, develop, and concentrate
the means of production and distribution, thus
creating a system of co-operative production. This
work was completed in advanced capitalist countries
about the beginning of the 20th century. That moment
capitalism had fulfilled its historic mission, and from
that moment the capitalist class became a class of
parasites.</p>

<p>In the course of human progress mankind has passed
(through class rule, private property, and individualism
in production and exchange) from the enforced and inevitable
want, misery, poverty, and ignorance of savagery
and barbarism to the affluence and high productive
capacity of civilization. For all practical purposes, co-operative
production has now superseded individual production.</p>

<p>Capitalism no longer promotes the greatest good of
the greatest number, It no longer spells progress, but
reaction. Private production carries with it private
ownership of the products. Production is carried on,
not to supply the needs of humanity, but for the profit
of the individual owner, the company, or the trust. The
worker, not receiving the full product of his labor, can
not buy back all he produces. The capitalist wastes part
in riotous living; the rest must find a foreign market.
By the opening of the twentieth century the capitalist
world&mdash;England, America, Germany, France, Japan,
China, etc.&mdash;was producing at a mad rate for the world
market. A capitalist deadlock of markets brought on in
1914 the capitalist collapse popularly known as the
World War. The capitalist world can not extricate itself
out of the debris. America today is choking under
the weight of her own gold and products.</p>

<p>This situation has brought on the present stage of
human misery&mdash;starvation, want, cold, disease, pestilence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and war. This state is brought about in the midst of
plenty, when the earth can be made to yield a hundredfold,
when the machinery of production is made to
multiply human energy and ingenuity by the hundreds.
The present state of misery exists solely because the
mode of production rebels against the mode of exchange.
Private property in the means of life has become
a social crime. The land was made by no man;
the modern machines are the result of the combined ingenuity
of the human race from time immemorial; the
land can be made to yield and the machines can be set
in motion only by the collective effort of the workers.
Progress demands the collective ownership of the land
on and the tools with which to produce the necessities
of life. The owner of the means of life today partakes
of the nature of a highwayman; he stands with his gun
before society's temple; it depends upon him whether
the million mass may work, earn, eat, and live. The
capitalist system of production and exchange must be
supplanted if progress is to continue.</p>

<p>In place of the capitalist system we must substitute a
system of social ownership of the means of production,
industrially administered by the workers, who assume
control and direction as well as operation of their industrial
affairs."</p></div>

<p>25. Define "class consciousness."</p>

<p>Ans.: Class consciousness of the workers means
that they are conscious of the fact that they, as a class,
have interests which are in direct conflict with the interests
of the capitalist class.</p>

<p>26. What function does the state perform in the
class struggle?</p>

<p>Ans.: "The state is a class instrument, and is the
public power of coercion created and maintained in
human societies by their division into classes, a power
which, being clothed with force, makes laws." It is,
therefore, used by the dominant class to keep the subject
working class in subjection in accordance with
the interests of the ruling and owning class. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
also used to prevent the workers from altering the
economic structure of society in the interests of the
working class.</p>

<p>As the author of the catechism, of which these twenty-six
questions and answers constitute a small part, says:</p>

<p>"Society is a growth subject to the laws of evolution.
When evolution reaches a certain point, revolution
becomes necessary in order to break the bonds of the
old and bring in the new. As the chicken grows
through evolution until it reaches the point where it
must break its shell (the revolution) in order to continue
its growth, so do classes of people come to the
point in their evolution where revolution is necessary
in order to continue their growth, bring in the new
society and consummate the next step in civilization."</p>

<p>Since 1913, when the foregoing catechism was published,
we have had the war to end war and to make the
world safe for democracy&mdash;a fateful and mournful war
in which millions of lives were lost and other millions
wrecked with the result of multiplying wars and increasing
imperialism.</p>

<p>It was a war between national groups of capitalists
with conflicting interests for commercial advantages,
which is unexpectedly issuing in three great crises: (1)
the imminent bankruptcy of capitalism; (2) the communist
revolution in Russia, and (3) the imminent taking
over of the world by the revolutionary proletariat.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the sons and daughters of capitalism have
owned the earth with all that thereon and therein is.
Henceforth, the sons and daughters of the useful
workers shall be the owners.</p>

<p>The future belongs to the workers, but not until
they organize themselves into one big revolutionary
union. What ideas and aims are involved in the faith
and endeavor of Revolutionary Unionism will appear
from this passage in Comrade Philip Kurinsky's Industrial
Unionism and Revolution, a brilliant pamphlet,
published by The Union Press, Box 205, Madison
Square, New York City:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Slavery is not abolished. It is merely a change in
the struggle which throws itself hither and thither like
the waves of the seas. In ancient times chattel slavery
existed. Feudalism then took its place. Feudalism
in its turn was overthrown by capitalism which
at present reigns supreme. As the immortal Tolstoy
explained, 'The abolition of the old slavery is similar
to that which Tartars did to their captives. After they
had cut up their heels they placed stones and sand in
the wounds and then took the chains off. The Tartars
were sure that when the feet of their prisoners were
swollen, that they could not run away and would have
to work even without chains. Such is the slavery of
wages'.</p>

<p>Of this slavery does revolutionary unionism speak
in the name of the revolutionary worker. It analyzes
the present society and shows that it is divided into
two economic classes. One class, the capitalist class,
is the master class which controls all the factories,
mills, mines, railroads, lands and fields and all the
finished and raw materials. This class possesses all
the natural riches of the world and this economic supremacy
gives it control of the state, of the church, and
of all educational institutions. In short, this class owns
everything and controls the whole social and political
life of each country. The other class, the working
class, owns nothing. It produces all and enjoys little.
It uses the machines and tools but does not possess
them, and is therefore forced to sell its only possession,
its labor power, to the master class. And the latter
uses the opportunity to buy that wonderful power like
any raw material or some other commodity (some of
the representatives of craft unionism wish to deny
this but unsuccessfully). For the commodity which
the worker is compelled to sell in order that he might
live, he receives a wage which is determined as is the
price of every other commodity. The price is always
smaller than the value of the product which the worker
produces for the capitalist.</p>

<p>Between these two classes there must, naturally,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
exist a tremendous struggle which often has the character
of actual war. No one urges the workers to this war&mdash;not
the terrible I. W. W.'s nor the political socialist,
neither the Bolsheviks nor the Anarchists, but the war
naturally and inevitably arises from existing conditions.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the capitalists are continually
chasing after higher profits which results in the employment
of cheap labor under the worst conditions.
Naturally the ideal of the capitalist class is to keep
the workers in a condition of slavery. If the workers
attempt to revolt, as they do daily, their masters try
to suppress the revolt with all the power at their command.
On the other hand, the workers struggle with
all their power to lighten their burdens. They strive
to get better conditions, higher wages and shorter hours,
and in general the ideal of the working class is to
throw off the yoke of capitalism.</p>

<p>No one rightfully can say that this struggle is merely
a theory. We can see this struggle in the attempts
of the capitalist class to destroy the victorious Russian
Proletariat. It is mirrored before our eyes in the continual
strikes. Nothing can stop this struggle except
the abolition of exploitation.</p>

<p>No matter how hard the Citizens' Committees,
Boards of Arbitration, of Conciliation and of Mediation,
with their so-called impartial members try to
convince the world that it is possible to bring the warring
classes into closer relations, their attempts are
doomed to failure. At best their success is only temporary
and their efforts succeed only in blinding the
eyes of the working masses. And if at some time these
boards claim a victory, the credit is not due to them,
but to the force exerted by the workers. It is the
strike-weapon, held in reserve by the toilers, that
brings victory to the workers&mdash;not the efforts of the
philanthropic gentlemen. Furthermore the efforts of
these gentlemen greatly harm the workers, for at times
when the workers can attain success through the use
of the strike, these philanthropists interfere, and deaden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the initiative and aggressiveness of the strikers. Often
this causes strife between the strikers themselves.
They lose confidence in one another, and the existence
of the organizations which the workers succeeded in
building up through their efforts and sacrifices are
jeopardized.</p>

<p>The "Conciliation," however, can bring no conciliation
between the employers and workers, because that
is unnatural. On the contrary, the hatred of one side
to the other is intensified and war breaks out oftener
and assumes a more bitter and more obstinate character.</p>

<p>Thus viewing the two struggling classes of capitalist
society, revolutionary industrial unionism comes to
the logical conclusion that between capital and labor
there exists nothing in common, that the struggle must
go on and peace can come only when economic oppression
will cease, which is possible only when the program of
revolutionary unionism will be realized; namely, when
the workers will take over the means of production and
abolish the system of private ownership. The autocratic
control of industry, the unequal division of products will
then disappear and society will be built on a socialist
foundation, where the industries will be owned and
operated by the workers, organized in a truly democratic
manner, and where the individual will receive the full
product of his labor.</p>

<p>These are the principles of revolutionary unionism,
the principles of the international proletariat. They
are the true expressions of the class struggle and because
of that, revolutionary unionism attracts more
and more followers whose ideal is to develop within
the working masses a consciousness of their historic
mission."</p></div>

<p>In the words of an eloquent representative of the
organized workers in the United States, I exhort the
working men and working women of America: Keep
your eyes on Russia. Watch what is going on there and
what the capitalist plunderbund will try to do. Do not
be misled by the lies and slanders that are daily dished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
up to you. Bear in mind that those who tell you these
yarns have an interest to mislead you. They want to
use you as a makeweight in their game of wresting
from the Russian workers their dearly-won liberty. It
is of no use to enumerate the lies that have already been
punctured because they will invent new ones faster than
one can write and print. Let your reason guide you.
Think yourselves into the shoes of your Russian fellow
workers. Think how you would act if placed in the
same position and then draw the conclusion that they
act about the same way that you would, because they are
like you moved by the same emotions, the same desires,
the same aspirations. You, too, would like to keep for
yourselves the fruits of your toil, if you only knew how
to go about it, if you had the organization that would
make it possible. But as yet you do not know and you
have not that organization. In politics you still vote
against one another in the Republican or Democratic
camp. You will have to wait until you do know and
until you do have the means&mdash;the Industrial Unions of
the entire working class that will be able to take and
hold and administer industry for the reason that it will
have the might, the power to do so. And when you have
expressed through the ballot your will for that new
society, which will guarantee to you the full fruits of
your labor, remember the slogan of revolutionary Russia:
"All power to the Soviets," and let your slogan then be:
"All power to the Industrial Unions!"</p>

<p>These are prophetic words written fifty years ago by
Frederick Engels:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Since the historical appearance of the capitalist mode
of production, the appropriation by society of all the
means of production has often been dreamed of, more
or less vaguely, by individuals, as well as by sects, as
the ideal of the future. But it could become possible,
could become a historical necessity, only when the actual
conditions for its realization were there. Like every
other social advance, it becomes practicable, not by men
understanding that the existence of classes is in contradiction
to justice, equality, etc., not by the mere will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>ingness
to abolish these classes, but by virtue of certain
new economic conditions.... So long as the total
social labor only yields a produce which but slightly exceeds
that barely necessary for the existence of all; so
long, therefore, as labor engages all or almost all the
time of the great majority of the members of society&mdash;so
long, of necessity, this society is divided into
classes....</p>

<p>But if, upon this showing, division into classes has
a certain historical justification, it has this only for a
given period, only under given social conditions. It was
based on the insufficiency of production. It will be swept
away by the complete development of modern productive
forces. And, in fact, the abolition of classes in society
presupposes a degree of historical evolution, at which
the existence, not simply of this or that particular ruling
class, but of any ruling class at all, has become an
obsolete anachronism....</p>

<p>With the seizing of the means of production by
society, production of commodities is done away with,
and, simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the
producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by
systematic, definite organization. The struggle for individual
existence disappears. Then for the first time
man, in a certain sense, is finally marked off from the
rest of the animal kingdom, and emerges from mere
animal conditions into really human ones.... It
is the ascent of man from the kingdom of necessity to
the kingdom of freedom.</p></div>

<p>The capitalist countries are ruled through banks, and
a bank is necessarily an institution of the owning class.</p>

<p>Russia is ruled through Soviets, and a soviet is necessarily
an institution of the working class.</p>

<p>Banks and Soviets are so many headquarters for big
unions. In capitalist countries the banks are such for
the one big union of the owners, and in Russia the soviets
are this for the one big union of the workers. These
big unions cannot co-exist and flourish in the same country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>All owners everywhere see the necessity for their one
big union and in all capitalistic countries, nowhere more
than in the United States, they have the advantage of
being on the ground floor and indeed on all the floors
of all the sky scrapers with their union which is the
most universally inclusive and the most relentlessly
efficient organization on earth.</p>

<p>Some workers everywhere see the necessity for their
one big union, but nowhere is it seen as generally and
clearly as in Russia,&mdash;the only country in which the
workers have held the ground floor for any considerable
time against all comers.</p>

<p>In all countries a beginning has been made by the
workers in laying the foundation for their one big union,
but in only one country, Russia, has progress been made
with the superstructure, and here as everywhere the
owners have hindered the workers so that they must defend
themselves with their right hand while they build
with their left. Nevertheless wonderful progress is
being made and when the industrial structure has been
completed, as it soon must be, else the world is doomed
to destruction, it shall tower above its capitalist rival as
a mountain over a foot hill.</p>

<p>After all, the power of the owner is money and it is
not a real potentiality, for within the social realm there
is in reality only one potentiality, the power of productivity
which exclusively belongs to the worker.</p>

<p>In the sky there is no god, and on earth there is no
king or priest like unto Labor, the lord of gods, the tzar
of kings and the pope of priests.</p>

<p>Labor is high above all potentialities. The motto,
"All Power to the Workers," which the class-conscious
proletarians inscribe on their banners, is not the expression
of an ideal fiction, but the declaration of a
practical reality, the greatest among all realities, that
reality in which the whole social realm lives, moves and
has its being.</p>

<p>Down with the one big union of the owners. Long
live the one big union of the workers.</p>

<p>Many critics contend that socialism and supernaturalism
are not, as I represent, incompatibilities; but
they lose sight of four facts: (1) this is a scientific age;
(2) Marxian socialism is one of the sciences; (3) the
vast majority of men of science reject all supernaturalism,
including of course the gods and devils with their
heavens and hells, and (4) only in the case of one of
the sciences, psychology, is this majority greater than
in the science of sociology.</p>

<p>The truth of the last two of these representations
will be overwhelmingly evident from the chart on the
next page. It and its explanation given in the following
quotation is taken with the kind consent of the
author and also of the publishers of a book entitled
God and Immortality, by Professor James H. Leuba,
the Psychologist of Bryn Mawr College. This book
is having a great influence and I strongly recommend
it to all who think that I am wrong in the
contention that conscious, personal existence is limited
to earth; that, therefore, we are having all that we
shall ever know of heaven and hell, here and now, and
that whether we have more of heaven and less of hell
depends altogether upon men and women, not at all upon
gods and devils. The second edition of Professor
Leuba's book is now in the press of The Open Court
Publishing Company, 122 South Michigan Ave., Chicago,
Ill. Here is the quotation in support of our contentions:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

PARTIAL SUMMARY OF RESULTS" title="" />

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>What, then, is the main outcome of this research?
Chart XI, Partial Summary of Results, shows that in
every class of persons investigated, the number of believers
in God is less, and in most classes very much less
than the number of non-believers, and that the number
of believers in immortality is somewhat larger than in a
personal God; that among the more distinguished, unbelief
is very much more frequent than among the less
distinguished; and finally that not only the degree of
ability, but also the kind of knowledge possessed, is significantly
related to the rejection of these beliefs.</p>

<p>The correlation shown, without exception, in every
one of our groups between eminence and disbelief appears
to me of momentous significance. In three of
these groups (biologists, historians, and psychologists)
the number of believers among the men of greater distinction
is only half, or less than half the number of believers
among the less distinguished men. I do not see
any way to avoid the conclusion that disbelief in a personal
God and in personal immortality is directly proportional
to abilities making for success in the sciences
in question.</p>

<p>A study of the several charts of this work with regard
to the kind of knowledge which favors disbelief shows
that the historians and the physical scientists provide the
greater; and the psychologists, the sociologists and the
biologists, the smaller number of believers. The explanation
I have offered is that psychologists, sociologists,
and biologists in very large numbers have come to recognize
fixed orderliness in organic and psychic life, and not
merely in inorganic existence; while frequently physical
scientists have recognized the presence of invariable law
in the inorganic world only. The belief in a personal God
as defined for the purpose of our investigation is, therefore,
less often possible to students of psychic and of organic
life than to physical scientists.</p>

<p>The place occupied by the historians next to the physical
scientists would indicate that for the present the
reign of law is not so clearly revealed in the events with
which history deals as in biology, economics, and psy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>chology.
A large number of historians continue to see
the hand of God in human affairs. The influence, destructive
of Christian beliefs, attributed in this interpretation
to more intimate knowledge of organic and psychic
life, appears incontrovertibly, as far as psychic life
is concerned, in the remarkable fact that whereas in
every other group the number of believers in immortality
is greater than that in God, among the psychologists the
reverse is true; the number of believers in immortality
among the greater psychologists sinks to 8.8 per cent.
One may affirm it seems that, in general, the greater the
ability of the psychologist, the more difficult it becomes
for him to believe in the continuation of individual life
after bodily death.</p></div>

<p>Within the generation to which I belong Darwin
and Marx, the greatest teachers that the world has
had, went over the top of entrenched ignorance
with the greatest books of the world, worth infinitely
more to it than all its bibles together. Darwin did
this in 1859 with his Origin of Species by Natural
Selection and Marx in 1867 with his Capital, a
Critique of Political Economy.</p>

<p>Darwin with his book is driving the Christian
church out of its trench of supernaturalism and
uniqueism by showing that the different kinds of
vegetable and animal life are not, according to the
representation of its bible, so many separate creations
by a personal, conscious divinity, but interrelated
evolutions by an impersonal, unconscious nature, the
higher out of the lower, and that, therefore, man is so
far from being a special creation, having his most
vital relationships with a celestial divinity and his
most glorious prospects in a heavenly place with him,
that he is really more or less closely related to every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
living thing on earth, and is as hopelessly limited to
it, as an elephant, a tree or even a mountain.</p>

<p>Marx with his book is driving the states out of the
trench of imperialism and capitalism.</p>

<p>As Darwin is driving the conscious, personal gods
out of the realm of biology, placing all animal and
human life of body, mind and soul on essentially the
same footing, so Marx is driving all such divinities
out of the realm of sociology, placing all life of family,
state, church, lodge, store and shop on essentially the
same level.</p>

<p>According to Darwin, all animal life is what it is
at any time by reason of the effort to accommodate
the physical organism to its environment.</p>

<p>According to Marx, human civilization is what it is
at any time because of the economic system by which
people feed, clothe and house themselves.</p>

<p>This Darwinian-Marxian interpretation of terrestrial
life in general, and of the human part of it in
particular, is known as materialism. It is the
materialistic, naturalistic, levelistic interpretation of
history, and differs fundamentally from the spiritualistic,
supernaturalistic, uniqueistic interpretation of
Christian preachers. The contrast between these interpretations
is especially strong in the case of human
history.</p>

<p>On the one hand the Christian preacher says, man's
history is what it is because of the directing providence
of a God, the Father, Son and Spirit, and because
of His directing inspiration of great leaders,
such as Washington, Luther, Caesar and Moses.</p>

<p>On the other hand Darwin and Marx agree in saying
that both the triune god and the inspired leader<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
are what they are, because society is what it is; that,
again, the character of society depends upon the
economic system by which it feeds, clothes and houses
itself, and that finally all such systems owe their
existence to the machinery in use for the production
of the basic necessities of life, the primal machine
being the human hand to which all other machines
are auxiliaries.</p>

<p>The most insatiable and universal among all
human longings is for freedom&mdash;freedom from
economic want, social inequality and imperialistic
tyranny, also freedom to learn, think, live and teach
truths.</p>

<p>Socialism of the Marxian type is the gospel of freedom,
because a classless god, nature, reveals it in the
interest of a classless world: therefore, it is true, and
slavery, of which there never was so much before on the
earth, and nowhere is there more than in the United
States, is utterly incompatible with truth, and classless
interests.</p>

<p>All the supernaturalistic gospels are revealed by a
class god (Jesus, Jehovah, Allah, Buddha) in the
interest of the capitalist class: therefore, they are
false and freedom is utterly incompatible with falsehood
and class interest.</p>

<p>Ignorance is the destroyer-god and capitalism is
the diabolical scourge by which he afflicts the wage-earner
with many unnecessary sufferings, especially
the crushing ones arising from the great trinity of
evils, war, poverty and slavery.</p>

<p>Knowledge is the saviour-god and Marxism is his
divine gospel of freedom from these capitalistic sufferings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

NEW TESTAMENT PERSONAGES.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What man of sense will agree with the statement that
the first, second, and third days, in which the evening is
named and the morning, were without sun, moon and
stars? What man is found such an idiot as to suppose
that God planted trees in Paradise like an husbandman?
I believe that every man must hold these things for
images under which a hidden sense is concealed.&mdash;Origen.</p></div>


<p>One of the critics of Communism and Christianism
whose representations are in alignment with several
others says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While the Bishop speaks in the language of scholarship,
he entirely ignores all the findings of modern scholars
on the literature of the Bible.</p></div>

<p>The failure to show more clearly that my representations
concerning the untenableness of the basic doctrines
of Christian supernaturalism are in alignment
with the conclusions of outstanding authorities in the
newly developed sciences of historical and biblical
criticisms is indeed a defect and an attempt will here
be made to remove it by a short but faithful and, as I
think, convincing summary of what such authorities in
these sciences have to say on the subject.</p>

<p>My summary is summarized from a pamphlet by
Charles T. Gorham, published by Watts and Company,
17 Johnson's Court, Fleet St., E. C. 4, London,
England, which is itself an able summarization of the
relevant facts which have been scientifically established
as they are given in the greatest of all the Bible
Dictionaries, the Encyclopedia Biblica.</p>

<p>It will be seen that all except one among my contentions
concerning the baselessness of the supernaturalism
of orthodox Christians are well sustained. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
exception is the contention that Jesus is not an historical
personage, but a fictitious one. However the
great critics are unanimously with me even in this,
for two crushing facts are admitted by them: (1) the
Old Testament affords no scientifically established data
from which a reliable history of the Jews can be written,
and (2) the New Testament has no such data for a
biography of Jesus.</p>

<p>The illuminating summary which is a large part of
my answer to the criticism under review follows, and
it is as far as possible in the language of Mr. Gorham:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Once upon a time there was a system of Christian
Theology. It was a wonderful though a highly artificial
structure, composed of fine old crusted dogmas
which no one could prove, but very few dared to dispute.
There was the "magnified man" in the sky, the
Infallible Bible, dictated by the Holy Spirit, the Trinity,
the Fall, the Atonement, Predestination and Grace, Justification
by Faith, a Chosen People, a practically omnipotent
Devil, myriads of Evil Spirits, an eternity of
bliss to be obtained for nothing, and endless torment for
those who did not avail themselves of the offer.</p>

<p>Now the house of cards has tumbled to pieces, or
rather it is slowly dissolving, as Shakespeare says, "like
the baseless fabric of a vision". The Biblical chronology,
history, ethics, all are alike found to be defective and
doubtful. Divine Revelation has become discredited; a
Human Record takes its place. What has brought about
this startling change? The answer is, Knowledge.
Thought, research, criticism, have shown that the traditional
theories of the Bible can no longer be maintained.
The logic of facts has confirmed the reasonings
of the independent thinker, and placed the dogmatist in
a dilemma which grows ever more acute. The result is
not pleasant for the believer; but it is well that the real
state of things should be known, that the kernel of truth
should be separated from the overgrown husk of tradition.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>During the last few years a work has been issued
which sums up the conclusions of modern criticism better
than any other book. It is called the Encyclopedia
Biblica, and its four volumes tersely and ably set forth
the new views, and support them by a mass of learning
which deserves serious consideration. And the most
significant thing about it is not merely that the entire
doctrinal system of Christianity has undergone a radical
change, but that this change has largely been brought
about by Christian scholars themselves. A rapid glance
at this store-house of the heresy of such scholars will give
the reader some idea of the extent of the surrender
which Christianity has made to the forces of Rationalism.
It must be premised that space will permit of the
conclusions only being given, without the detailed evidence
by which they are supported.</p>

<p>Let us begin with our supposed first parents. Is the
story of Adam and Eve a true story? There are, we
are told, decisive reasons why we cannot regard it as
historical, and probably the writer himself never supposed
he was relating history.<a name="Ktop" id="Ktop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#K">[K]</a></span></p>

<p>The Creation story originated in a stock of primitive
myths common to the Semitic races, and passed through
a long period of development before it was incorporated
in the book of Genesis. If, then, it is the fact, as Christian
scholars assert, that this story of the Creation originated
in a pagan myth, and was shaped and altered by
unknown hands for nearly a thousand years, it is nothing
more nor less than superstition to hold that it is
divinely true.</p>

<p>As for the Old Testament patriarchs, we now learn
that their very existence is uncertain. The tradition
concerning Abraham is, as it stands, inadmissible; he is
not so much a historical personage as an ideal type of
character, whose actual existence is as doubtful as that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>of other heroes. All the stories of the patriarchs are
legendary.</p>

<p>The whole book of Genesis, in fact, is not history at
all, as we understand history. Exodus is another composite
legend which has long been mistaken for history.</p>

<p>The historical character of Moses has not been established,
and it is doubtful whether the name is that of an
individual or that of a clan. The story of his being exposed
in an ark of bulrushes is a myth probably derived
from the similar and much earlier myth of Sargon.<a name="Ltop" id="Ltop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#L">[L]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to the New Testament, we find that modern
critical research only brings out more clearly than ever
the extraordinary vagueness and uncertainty which enshroud
every detail of the narrative. From the article
on "Chronology" we learn that everything in the Gospels
is too uncertain to be accepted as historical fact.
There are numerous questions which it is "wholly impossible
to decide". We do not know when Jesus was
born, or when he died, or who was his father, or what
was the duration of his ministry. As these are matters
on which the Gospel writers purport to give information,
the fact of their failure to do so settles the question of
their competency as historians.</p>

<p>The supposed supernatural birth of Jesus has of late
exercised the minds of theologians. It is not surprising
that some of them should reject the notion, for it is one
without a shred of evidence in its favor. Setting aside
the well-known fact that many other religions assume a
similar origin for their founders, we may note the New
Testament accounts are in such hopeless conflict with
each other that reconciliation is impossible.</p>

<p>The important subject of the "Resurrection" is treated
by Professor P. W. Schmiedel, of Zurich, who tells us
that the Gospel accounts "exhibit contradictions of the
most glaring kind".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The article on the Gospels by Dr. E. A. Abbott and
Professor Schmiedel is crammed with criticism of a kind
most damaging to every form of the orthodox faith.
The view hitherto current, that the four Gospels were
written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and appeared
thirty or forty years after the death of Jesus,
can, it is stated, no longer be maintained.</p>

<p>The alleged eclipse of the sun at the Crucifixion is impossible.
One of the orthodox shifts respecting this
phenomenon is that it was an eclipse of the moon!</p>

<p>Modern criticism decides that no confidence whatever
can be placed in the reliability of the Gospels as historical
narratives, or in the chronology of the events which they
relate. It may even seem to justify a doubt whether any
credible elements at all are to be found in them. Yet it
is believed that some such credible elements do exist.
Five passages prove by their character that Jesus was a
real person, and that we have some trustworthy facts
about him. These passages are: Matthew xii. 31,
Mark x. 17, Mark iii. 21, Mark xiii. 32, and Mark xv. 34,
and the corresponding passage in Matthew xxvii. 46,
though these last two are not found in Luke. Four other
passages have a high degree of probability&mdash;viz., Mark
viii. 12, Mark vi. 5, Mark viii. 14-21, and Matthew xi.
5, with the corresponding passage in Luke vii. 22. These
texts, however, disclose nothing of a supernatural character.
They merely prove that in Jesus we have to do
with a completely human being, and that the divine is
to be sought in him only in the form in which it is capable
of being found in all men.<a name="Mtop" id="Mtop"></a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#M">[M]</a></span></p>

<p>The four Gospels were compiled from earlier materials
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>which have perished, and the dates when they first appeared
in their present form are given as follows:&mdash;Mark,
certainly after the destruction of Jerusalem in
the year 70; Matthew, about 119 A. D.; Luke, between
100 and 110; and John, between 132 and 140.</p>

<p>The question of the genuineness of the Pauline Epistles,
is now far from being so clear as was once universally
supposed. Advanced criticism, Professor Van Manen
tells us in his elaborate article on "Paul", has learned
to recognize that none of these Epistles are by him, not
even the four generally regarded as unassailable. They
are not letters to individuals, but books or pamphlets
emanating from a particular school. We know little, in
reality, of the facts of Paul's life, or of his death: all is
uncertain. The unmistakable traces of late origin indicate
that the Epistles probably did not appear till the
second century.</p>

<p>The strange book of Revelation is not of purely Christian
origin. Criticism has clearly shown that it can no
longer be regarded as a literary unit, but it is an admixture
of Jewish with Christian ideas and speculations.
Ancient testimony, that of Papias in particular, assumed
the Presbyter John, and not the Apostle, as its author or
redactor.</p>

<p>The Epistles of Peter, James and Jude are none of
them held to be the work of the Apostles. They probably
first saw the light in the second century; the second
Epistle of Peter may even belong to the latter half of
that period.</p>

<p>All the above conclusions are summarized, as nearly
as may be, in the words of the authors of the respective
articles. Their significance is surely enormous. Right
or wrong, eminent Christian scholars here proclaim results
in complete antagonism to the ideas usually accepted
as forming the true basis of the Christian faith. They
amount, in fact, to a complete and unconditional surrender
of the whole dogmatic framework which has hitherto
been held as divinely revealed, and therefore divinely
true.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Paine was a Deist. As such he believed
that nature may be compared with a clock and God
with its maker. As the clock maker, under normal
conditions, has but little to do with his handiwork, so
it has been with the Creator and his universe. The
theists of every name (Christian, Jew, Mohammedan
and Buddhist), not to speak of others, believe that the
universe, with all which therein is, lives, moves and
has its being as the result of the willings of their respective
gods.</p>

<p>Though I have my god, indeed two gods, one god in
the world of my physical existence&mdash;a trinity: matter,
force and motion, and another god in the world of my
moral existence&mdash;a trinity: fact, truth and life, yet if
the rejection of both deism and theism is atheism, I
am an atheist.</p>

<p>But assuming for the sake of argument that there
is a conscious personal being who has had and is having
something to do with making things what they
are, I set my seal to this arraignment:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of all the systems of religion that were ever invented,
there is none more derogatory to the Almighty, more
unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more
contradictory in itself, than this thing called Christianity.
Too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too
inconsistent for practice, it renders the heart torpid, or
produces only atheists and fanatics. As an engine of
power, it serves the purpose of despotism and as a means
of wealth, the avarice of priests; but for the good of
mankind it leads to nothing here or hereafter.</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;Thomas Paine.</p></div>

<p>William Rathbone Greg in his Creed of Christendom
says that much of the Old Testament which
Christian divines, in their ignorance of Jewish lore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
have insisted on receiving and interpreting literally,
the informed Rabbis never dreamed of regarding as
anything but allegorical. The literalists they called
fools.</p>

<p>Origen and Augustine, the two greatest men which
Christianity has produced, would agree with Greg in
this. We have already quoted the motto of this section
from Origen, and we will now quote this from Augustine:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It very often happens that there is some question
as to the earth or the sky, or the other elements
of this world, respecting which one who is not a
Christian has knowledge derived from most certain reasoning
or observation, and it is very disgraceful and mischievous
and of all things to be carefully avoided, that a
Christian, speaking of such matters as being according
to the Christian Scriptures, should be heard by an unbeliever
talking such nonsense that the unbeliever, perceiving
him to be as wide from the mark as east from
west, can hardly restrain himself from laughing.</p></div>

<p>My revolt against the existing capitalist system of
economics and the capitalized political and religious
systems which support it is complete, and the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
which I have in view in this booklet is that of primitive
Christianism, as it is taught by Mary in the Magnificat,
the putting down of the owning masters of the
world and the exaltation of the working slaves, only
that I do not recommend, as she did, that the masters
should be banished to starve but rather that they
should be allowed to become producers and to live
then as such, not as robbers, as they now live.</p>

<p>This is bolshevism. It is not anarchy, but a new
dictatorship instead of the old, that of the proletariat
in place of the bourgeoisie. But this dictatorship
(though necessary during the period of transition from
the capitalist system, by which commodities are made
only for the profit of a few to an industrial system by
which they will be made only for use of the many)
is not the goal of socialism. Its goal is a classless
world&mdash;a world in which all who are able to work
shall directly or at least indirectly contribute their due
proportion, according to their abilities and opportunities,
towards feeding, clothing, housing and educating
it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the truest thing in the Bible relates to the
utterly corrupt condition of civilization, nor was it
ever truer than now, and it always must be equally
true while the world is divided into master and slave
classes under the dictatorship of the masters:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The whole head is sick and the whole heart faint.
From the sole of the foot even unto the head, there is
no soundness in it, but wounds and bruises, and putrifying
sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up,
neither mollified with ointment.</p></div>

<p>Capitalism and Socialism differ fundamentally in
that the former always has sought and always will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
seek to exercise a permanent dictatorship, whereas
that of the latter is to constitute the temporary bridge
over which the world is to pass from the economic system
under which commodities are competitively made
for the profit of the few, to the economic system under
which they will be co-operatively made for the use of
the many.</p>

<p>It is contended with much show of reason that the
dictatorship of the proletariat will not lead to the goal,
because human nature being what it is the slaves will
automatically develop into another class of masters.</p>

<p>But those who raise this contention proceed upon
the assumption that human nature is a constant quantity
so that it cannot be essentially changed and that
it has made the economic systems, what they have
been.</p>

<p>This is not the case. Human nature, like animal nature,
is constantly changing and neither the one nor
the other voluntarily changes itself, but both are
forced to change by the development of new and external
conditions and by the necessity of conformity
to them.</p>

<p>Professor Joseph McCabe, not a socialist, observes
that these developments and conformities were so
many revolutions and that the man who says, the
secret of progress is evolution, not revolution, may be
talking very good social philosophy but he is not talking
science, as he thinks. In every modern geological
work you read of periodical revolutions in the story
of the earth, and these are the great ages of progress&mdash;and,
I ought to add, of colossal annihilation of the less
fit.</p>

<p>Darwin discovered that animal nature changed (for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
example snake nature changed into bird nature) because
of changed physical environments and the necessity
of life to adaptation to them.</p>

<p>Marx discovered that human nature changed from
what it was during the period of chatteldom to what
it was during serfdom and from that to what it is
under capitalism by reason of the difference in the
economic systems of these periods by which the world
fed, clothed and housed itself and that these differences
are in turn accounted for by the differences in the machines
by which the necessities of life are produced.</p>

<p>Thus Darwin explained the history of animal life
without the hypothesis of a divine creator, and Marx
explained the history of mankind without the hypothesis
either of a divine ruler or human leaders. These
Darwinian and Marxian explanations constitute what
is known as the materialistic explanation of history.</p>

<p>Marx represented that capitalism would end the
class struggle and issue in a classless world because its
profiteering system of production and distribution
could not be succeeded by another, since it divides
mankind into masters who are ever growing less numerous
and slaves who are ever growing more numerous,
without the possibility of those who are half capitalists
and half workers rising out of their nondescript
condition into a new master class, as did the bourgeoisie
under feudalism. For these reasons he contended
the proletarian slaves would become the grave
diggers for the bourgeois masters and so end capitalism
with the burial of its representatives.</p>

<p>But with the complete and sustained triumph of the
proletarian class the bourgeois class will rapidly pass
away, as is now the case with it in Russia, and a class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>less
world will be born to live on a co-operative instead
of a competitive basis, in a heaven instead of a
hell.</p>

<p>In general outline the form of the workers' state
will be that of the Russian Soviet Republic, and what
it is will appear from the following semi-official description,
the briefest and clearest of any which I have
seen. Its authorship is unknown to me but I know
it to be the work of a committee of which Zinoviev,
one of the directing and inspiring minds of the
proletarian movement in Russia, was a member, and
it may be that he is the author. Anyhow it is a recently
published, authoritative classic containing the
information for which a large part of the world has
been waiting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have before us the example of the Russian Soviet
Republic, whose structure, in view of the conflicting reports
printed in other countries, it may be useful to describe
briefly here.</p>

<p>The unit of government is the local Soviet, or Council,
of Workers', Red Army, and Peasants' Deputies.</p>

<p>The city Workers' Soviet is made up as follows:
Each factory elects one delegate for a certain number of
workers, and each local union also elects delegates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>.
These delegates are elected according to political parties&mdash;or,
if the workers wish it, as individual candidates.</p>

<p>The Red Army delegates are chosen by military units.</p>

<p>For the peasants, each village has its local Soviet,
which sends delegates to the Township Soviet, which in
turn elects to the County Soviet, and this to the
Provincial Soviet.</p>

<p>Nobody who employs labor for profit can vote.</p>

<p>Every six months the City and Provincial Soviets
elect delegates to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets,
which is the supreme governing body of the country.
This Congress decides upon the policies which are to
govern the country for six months, and then elects a
Central Executive Committee of two hundred, which is
to carry out these policies. The Congress also elects
the Cabinet&mdash;The Council of People's Commissars, who
are heads of Government Departments&mdash;or People's
Commissariats.</p>

<p>The People's Commissars can be recalled at any time
by the Central Executive Committee. The members of
all Soviets can be recalled very easily, and at any time,
by their constituents.</p>

<p>These Soviets are not only Legislative bodies, but also
Executive organs. Unlike your Congress, they do not
make the laws and leave them to the President to carry
out, but the members carry out the laws themselves; and
there is no Supreme Court to say whether or not these
laws are "constitutional."</p>

<p>Between the All-Russian Congresses of Soviets the
Central Executive Committee is the supreme power in
Russia. It meets at least every two months, and in the
meanwhile, the Council of People's Commissars directs
the country, while the members of the Central Executive
Committee go to work in the various government departments.</p>

<p>In Russia the workers are organized in Industrial
Unions all the workers in each industry belonging to
one Union. For example, in a factory making metal
products, even the carpenters and painters are members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of the Metal Workers' Union. Each factory is a local
Union, and the Shop Committee elected by the workers
is its Executive Committee.</p>

<p>The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the
federated Unions is elected by the annual Trade Union
Convention. A Scale Committee elected by the Convention
fixes the wages of all categories of workers.</p>

<p>With very few exceptions, all important factories in
Russia have been nationalized, and are now the property
of all the workers in common. The business of the
Unions is therefore no longer to fight the capitalists, but
to run industry.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the Unions works the Department
of Labor of the Soviet Government, whose chief is the
People's Commissar of Labor, elected by the Soviet
Congress with the approval of the Unions.</p>

<p>In charge of the economic life of the country is the
elected Supreme Council of People's Economy, divided
into departments, such as, Metal Department, Chemical
Department, etc., each one headed by experts and
workers, appointed, with the approval of the Union by
the Supreme Council of People's Economy.</p>

<p>In each factory production is carried on by a committee
consisting of three members: a representative of
the Shop Committee of the Unions, a representative of
the Central Executive of the Unions, and a representative
of the Supreme Council of People's Economy.</p>

<p>The Unions are thus a branch of the government&mdash;and
this government is the most highly centralized
government that exists.</p>

<p>It is also the most democratic government in history.
For all the organs of government are in constant touch
with the working masses, and constantly sensitive to
their will. Moreover, the local Soviets all over Russia
have complete autonomy to manage their own local
affairs, provided they carry out the national policies laid
down by the Soviet Congress. Also, the Soviet Government
represents only the workers, and cannot help but
act in the workers' interests.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>The motto of this section is the conclusion of a good
article in the first number of one among the best of
the periodicals devoted to the promotion of Marxism,
The Workers' Council, published by the International
Educational Company, New York City. This article
is so short and lends itself so naturally as a supplement
to the foregoing explanation of the new economic
system which has been established and is being developed
in Russia that I quote the rest as the conclusion
of this section about Sovietism.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Communist Russia, the Russia of the common people,
marks a new epoch in the world's history. It marks a
basic change in the structure of human society. Up to
this time society lived under the rule of the few, under
the rule of the class which possessed the wealth of the
country. The methods were different at different periods
in the world's history, but the results were the same:
riches and power for the few, a bare existence and endless
toil for the many. The slaves, the serfs, or the
wage workers of today, who compose the masses of the
people, have ever been the hewers of wood and the
carriers of water, the beasts of burden on whose backs
sported and fattened kings and nobles, landlords and
capitalists. They who possessed wealth had the power.
And they passed laws to protect that power, to make
the possession of wealth a social institution. Private
property was enthroned and every striving of mankind
was subjected to the rule of property. Thence grew the
exploitation of man by man for private profit, and all
abuses resulting therefrom; fear of loss of property, care
of possession, dread of the future, fear of loss of
employment, envy and greed. Human society was ruled
by property grabbers; masters, kings, capitalists, providing
toil, disease, war for the masses of mankind. That
is the rule of capitalism, and cannot be otherwise.</p></div>

<p>But under communism, profit is abolished, and with
it the exploitation of man by man; private property is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
no longer a factor in the life of man; property becomes
universal, all natural and created wealth belong to
society, to every member of the community, as secure a
birth right as air and sunlight. Everybody's measured
work provides a common fund of things to satisfy
material needs, today, tomorrow and in years to come.
There can be no fear of losing one's job, of seeing one's
children starve, of the poor-house in old age. As sure as
the sun will rise on the morrow, man is secure of his
bread, his shelter and clothing. Man is freed from
animal cares, free to develop his human qualities, his intelligence,
his brain and heart.</p>

<p>Russia points the way. Russia is now one huge corporation,
every man, woman and child an equal shareholder.
The state is administered as a business; the
benefit of the stockholders being the object of the corporation.
The individual contributes his labor, whatever
it may be: manual, mental, artistic. This labor is
applied to available materials: the soil of the farm,
the natural resources, the mines, and mills and factories.
The finished product is distributed through the agencies
of the corporation, in the shape of food and clothes and
shelter, of education and amusement, of protection to
life and limb, of literature and art, of inventions and
improvements: to every man, woman and child of the
nation.</p>

<p>To be sure this ideal of a human brotherhood is not
yet realized in Russia. No sane person would expect so
tremendous a change to be consummated in three years,
in the face of universal aggression, intrigues and blockades.
It may take ten years, perhaps a generation. What
of it! Russia is past the most difficult period of
transition from the capitalist state to a communist state,
while other capitalist countries must still face the period
of revolution. Therefore let Russia lead the way. Let
the American workers realize that Russia's fight is their
fight, that Soviet Russia's success is the success of the
laboring people the world over!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="VI_WITHDRAWAL_OF_PRIZE_OFFER" id="VI_WITHDRAWAL_OF_PRIZE_OFFER"></a>VI. WITHDRAWAL OF PRIZE OFFER.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Never have anything to do with those who pretend
to have dealings with the supernatural. If
you allow supernaturalism to get a foothold in your
country the result will be a dreadful calamity.&mdash;Confucius.</p></div>


<p>Mrs. Brown and I hereby withdraw, for the present
at least, our prize offer, and for two reasons:</p>

<p>1. We are convinced that it is as necessary to the
welfare of the world to smite supernaturalism in religion
as capitalism in politics, but while many are able
and willing to attack the octopus of capitalism, this is
true of only a few in the case of the dragon of supernaturalism.
Some hesitate because they feel with one
of the critics of Communism and Christianism that
revolutionary forces are coming to the surface in the
churches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where," he asks, "shall we classify the stand of the
Catholic Church against the open shop? What shall
be said of the Interchurch report on the steel strike?
What of the attitude of the combined commission in
Denver of Catholics, Protestants and Jews on the
street car strike?"</p>

<p>We have no desire to belittle such efforts nor to
discourage their promoters; but (though they may afford
some local and temporary alleviation to the miseries
of far the greater part of the world&mdash;miseries
growing out of its division into two classes, a small
class of owning masters and a large class of working
slaves) we center no hope in them, because the whole
history of the supernaturalistic interpretations of religion,
not excepting the Christian, show these efforts
to be only reformatory and temporary bubbles which
sooner or later are always pricked by the masters of
what little revolutionary air they contain, and so never
issue in any general or permanent improvement of the
sad lot of the overwhelming majority of the slaves.</p>

<p>How little the church serves the working slaves, and
how much the owning masters, will appear from the
following representations of Roger W. Babson, the
well-known financial expert and adviser:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The value of our investments depends not on the
strength of our banks, but rather upon the strength of
our churches. The underpaid preachers of the nation
are the men upon whom we really are depending, rather
than the well-paid lawyers, bankers and brokers. The
religion of the community is really the bulwark of our
investments. And when we consider that only 15 per
cent of the people hold securities of any kind and less
than 3 per cent hold enough to pay an income tax, the
importance of the churches becomes even more evident.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>For our sakes, for our children's sakes, for the nation's
sake, let us business men get behind the churches
and their preachers. Never mind if they are not perfect.
Never mind if their theology is out of date. This only
means that were they efficient they would do very much
more. The safety of all we have is due to the churches,
even in their present inefficient and inactive state. By all
that we hold dear, let us from this very day give more
time, money and thought to the churches, for upon these
the value of all we own ultimately depends.</p></div>

<p>What our critics say about the recent efforts of the
American churches being in the right direction is interesting
to Mrs. Brown and me, but we are much
more impressed by the observation of a writer in a
late issue of Soviet Russia. In speaking of the baneful
influence of the Russian church through all the
ages he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Out of the shadows of antiquity, from the morning of
man's cupidity and avarice, two sinister figures have
crawled with crooked talons through history, leaving a
trail of blood and fear most horrible which has not
halted yet. These are the monarch and the priest.
The one is symbolical of despotic or oligarchic power,
the other typifies the sordid ignorance and fearful superstition
of the credulous masses which maintains the
power of the first. High in the streets of Moscow,
where one may see the pallid, long-haired, degenerate-looking
venders of holy lies and pious impositions shuffle
along like spectres from a remoter age, there hangs a
woven streamer of scarlet hue with huge white lettering,
which defiantly proclaims that religion is the opium of
the people.</p>

<p>Though many still cross themselves a score of times
daily on passing the church, yet nevertheless the people
are rapidly assimilating the knowledge which elevates
and enlightens, and learning to reject that which terrorizes
and deforms the mind, and just so sure as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
last filthy tyrant has been placed for ever beyond mischief,
so will the last priest soon vanish from the land
once contemptuously known as "Holy Russia".</p></div>

<p>The foregoing is from a revolutionary sympathizer
with soviet Russia and the following is from a reactionary
criticizer of it, but both are to the same
effect, that orthodox Christianity is wholly against the
interest of the proletariat and entirely for that of the
bourgeoisie:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One of the most striking characteristics of Bolshevism
is its pronounced hatred of religion, and of Christianity
most of all. To the Bolshevik, Christianity is not merely
the theory of a mode of life different from his own; it
is an enemy to be persecuted and wiped out of existence.</p>

<p>To understand this is not difficult. The tendency of
the Christian religion to hold before the believer an ideal
of a life beyond death is diametrically opposed to the
ideal of Bolshevism, which tempts the masses by promising
the immediate realization of the earthly paradise.
From that point of view Christianity is not only a false
conception of life; it is an obstacle to the realization of
the Communist ideal. It detaches souls from the objects
of sense and diverts them from the struggle to get the
good things of this life. According to the Bolshevist
formula, religion is opium for the people: and serves as
a tool of capitalist domination.</p></div>

<p>This influence of the churches, in the long run and
on the whole has been and will continue to be the
same throughout christendom everywhere and everywhen,
not excepting these United States in the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>Nor is it to any convincing purpose that the representatives
of the owning class contend that kings and
priests have lost their supremacy to presidents and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
preachers, for it is imperialism in politics which enthralls
and supernaturalism in religion which degrades.
The world is greatly afflicted with both, none of it
much, if any, more than our country.</p>

<p>It seems to us that we see two fundamentally important
facts more clearly than our critics see them:
(1) the first step in the way of salvation for the proletariat
is class consciousness, and (2) the Christian
interpretation of supernaturalistic religion has been,
and until it is discredited will continue to be the most
efficient among the many preventives to this consciousness.</p>

<p>Let me show this to be the case by an experience
which I had some years ago when Mr. Pierpont Morgan,
Senior, was at the height of his glory, as the king
of the great realm of big business, receiving homage
on the one hand from the Rockefellers and Rothschilds,
and on the other hand from the Blockheads
and Henry Dubbs of all the world.</p>

<p>At that time I made a confirmation visitation for
my sick episcopal brother, the Bishop of New York,
to what was popularly known as Pierpont Morgan's
church (St. George's, one of the downtown churches
for working people.) He was the senior warden of
this great parish having nearly 5,000 communicants.
He went with the collecting procession out through
the great congregation and back to the chancel where
each collector ceremoniously emptied the contents of
his basket into the great gold alms basin held by the
Rector.</p>

<p>While the famous financier was collecting contributions
from obscure toilers, how could any,
brought up as I was and as nearly all of the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
congregation were, see that capitalism has divided
humanity into two conflicting classes which "have
nothing in common, the working class and the employing
class, between which a struggle must go on
until the workers organize, take possession of the
earth and the machinery of production and abolish
the wage system!"</p>

<p>By the light of what I had been taught all along
and of what I was then seeing with my own eyes
from the bishop's chair such a representation would
have seemed preposterous and what was true of me
was equally so of all present, rector, wardens, vestrymen,
members and visitors.</p>

<p>There were not many I. W. W.'s. in those days, but
if one had been there and upon leaving the church
had made a representation to this effect to a fellow-worker
who was a member of St. George's would not
the reply have been something as follows:</p>

<p>See what Pierpont Morgan and I have in common:
the same God; the same religion; the same church;
the same services for worship; the same collection
basket in which he puts a $100.00 bill and I a ten cent
piece; the same Lord's Supper where we eat and
drink together; and, besides all this, there is the same
hell where he will go unless he gives me a fair day's
wage and where I will go unless I do a fair day's
work, and the same heaven where both will go to
equally glorious mansions, if we are alike 100 percenters
in church and state, and if he pays me liberally
for my work and I slave hard enough for his
money.</p>

<p>Assuming the truth of the Christian interpretation
of religion this conclusion is correct. But this Chris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>tian
religion is not true. Christianism offers nothing
to either the owners or workers in the sky for its
god and heaven, devil and hell are lies. And neither
religious Christianism nor political Republicanism or
Democracy, not to speak of the other isms of religion
and politics, offers the workers aught on earth.</p>

<p>Capitalism is the god of this world, of no part of
it more than of these United States, and capitalism
is to the laborer a robbing, lying, murderous devil,
not a good divinity.</p>

<p>2. The recall of the prize offer is also occasioned
and justified, we think, by a demand, which was as
unexpected as it is gratifying, for our little propagandist
in foreign countries, and we have been persuaded
that it should be met by securing to him the
gift of tongues. We propose to do this by devoting
the money which was set aside for the prizes to the
encouragement of making and publishing translations.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>My title, given in Latin on the picture page, is bestowed
upon me by some in jest and by others in reproach,
and I am accepting it from both as compliments,
because they prove that I have at least succeeded
in making clear the general outlines of my
religious and political position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of this title is due to the desire that those
who pick up the booklet should not buy it, much less
undertake to read it, under a mistaken impression as
to its doctrinal trends. In English the Latin title is,
"Bishop of the Countries belonging to the Bolsheviki
and the Infidels."</p>

<p>Certain friends greatly fear that some things said
in this booklet may fall foul of the criminal-syndicalism
laws. I have carefully read those of Ohio
and believe that the booklet contains nothing which
is not safely within them.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I have spoken the truth about supernaturalistic
religion and capitalistic politics as I
understand it, and I believe that I have adequately
supported all my representations on bases of relevant
facts which cannot be gainsaid or, at any rate, upon
sound arguments which have such facts for their
foundations.</p>

<p>However, I am trying to hold myself open to conviction;
and, this being the case, if "the powers that
be" in state or church feel that they must proceed
against me, I beg that, in justice to all the persons
and interests concerned, they will come with their resources
of persuasion, not coercion.</p>

<p>My appeal to the religious and political rulers to do
this shall be in the burning words of a celebrated defender
of the capitalistic system of economics, John
Stuart Mill, words which constitute the most remarkable
passage in his powerful essay on Liberty:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No argument, we may suppose, can now be needed,
against permitting a legislature or an executive, not
identified in interest with the people, to prescribe
opinions to them, and determine what doctrines or
what arguments they shall be allowed to hear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional countries,
to be apprehended, that the government, whether
completely responsible to the people or not, will often
attempt to control the expression of opinion, except
when in doing so it makes itself the organ of the
general intolerance of the public.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, therefore, that the government is
entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of
exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement
with what it conceives to be their voice.</p>

<p>But I deny the right of the people to exercise such
coercion, either by themselves or by their government.
The power itself is illegitimate. The best
government has no more title to it than the worst.
It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in
accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition
to it.</p>

<p>If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion,
and only one person were of the contrary opinion,
mankind would be no more justified in silencing that
one person, than he, if he had the power, would be
justified in silencing mankind.</p>

<p>Were an opinion a personal possession of no value
except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment
of it were simply a private injury, it would
make some difference whether the injury was inflicted
on only a few persons or on many. But the peculiar
evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is,
that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well
as the existing generation; those who dissent from
the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If
the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity
of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they
lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer
perception and livelier impression of truth, produced
by its collision with error.</p></div>

<p>This passage should be inscribed in letters of
gold on the doors of every church and court house in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the world. It was written in condemnation of the
persecution by majorities of minorities in states, but
it applies equally to all intolerance of dissentient
opinions.</p>

<p>It is utterly impossible in a printed discussion of
the length of this booklet to weed out every word
capable of misconstruction; and equally so to furnish
a definition or limitation to every doubtful word or
phrase. Nevertheless I call attention to a few:</p>

<p>The word "revolution" as used here should not be
taken as implying armed insurrection or violence,
unless expressly so described. These are not necessary
features of revolution. There have been both
political and industrial revolutions entirely unattended
by violence or bloodshed; for example, the political
revolution of 1787 when the old Articles of Confederation
were abolished and the federal Constitution
imposed upon the United States; also the political
and industrial revolution of 1919 in Hungary when
for a time a soviet system was established, with Bela
Kun as premier.</p>

<p>The bloodshed which often attends revolutions
comes almost invariably from the lawless counter-revolutionary
efforts of the deposed ruling class to
maintain themselves in power or regain power by
terrorism and murder.</p>

<p>When I eulogize the Bolsheviki and their system
in Russia, I am not to be taken as advocating for the
United States the employment of the bloody tactics
for gaining power, which the capitalist press of
America persists in describing&mdash;and as I believe,
falsely. I deal in this booklet not with tactics but
with facts. I concern myself here not with the ways<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
by which the Bolsheviki of Russia gained power, but
with what they did with the power after gaining it.</p>

<p>As I was trained in theology, I am certain that my
religious position has been so clearly outlined that
no mistake as to where I stand will be made by the
rulers in my church; but, having had no training in
the law, I am less certain that my political position
will be as unmistakably understood by the rulers in
my state. Therefore, to avoid misinterpretation of
certain words and phrases in this booklet, I here expressly
disclaim any intention of violating the
criminal-syndicalism statute of Ohio, following as
closely as may be its phraseology in these my denials
of criminal intention:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nothing herein is to be understood as advocating
or teaching the duty, necessity, or propriety
of crime, sabotage, violence or unlawful methods
of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial
or political reform. This booklet is not
issued for the purpose of advocating, advising, or
teaching the doctrine that industrial or political
reform should be brought about by crime,
sabotage, violence or unlawful methods of
terrorism; nor of justifying the commission or
the attempt to commit crime, sabotage, violence
or unlawful methods of terrorism with intent to
exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of
the doctrines of criminal syndicalism; nor of
organizing any society, group or assemblage of
persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines
of criminal syndicalism. If any such meaning
shall be read into any passage of this booklet by
any reader, it will be a wrong meaning, not what
I intended to convey.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>A revolution by which a new industrial democracy&mdash;the
freedom to make things for the use of workers&mdash;will
supplant the old capitalist democracy&mdash;the freedom
to make things for the profit of owners&mdash;is an
inevitable event in the history of every country
within the twentieth century.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>My object in this booklet is not the promotion of
class hatred and strife. Far from it. It is to persuade
to the banishment of gods from skies and capitalists
from earth.</p>

<p>Theism and capitalism are the great blights upon
mankind, the fatal ones to which it owes, more than
to all others together, the greatest and most unnecessary
of its suffering, those arising from ignorance,
war, poverty and slavery.</p>

<p>This recommendation as to banishments and this
representation in support of it stand out on nearly
every page of the booklet, and in order to make sure
of special prominence for them on its last pages, I
quote the following from an article by G. O. Warren
(a major in the British army, I think) an occasional
contributor of brilliant articles to rationalist publications
on sociological lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If there be a God who rules men and things by His
arbitrary will, it is an impertinence to attempt to
abolish poverty, because it is according to His will.
But if there be no such God, then we know that poverty
is caused by men and may be removed by men.
If there be a God who answers prayers, the remedy
for social injustice is to pray. But if there be no such
God, the remedy is to think and act.</p>

<p>If men go to heaven when they die, and if heaven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
is a place in which everybody will be made perfectly
happy, then there is no need to struggle against poverty
in this world, because a few years of trouble, or
even degradation, in this world are of no consequence
when compared with an eternity of happiness that
must be ours by simply following the directions of the
clergy. But if there be no such heaven, then it becomes
a matter of first importance that we make our
condition as happy as possible in this world, which
is the only one of which we are certain.</p>

<p>I maintain that there is no God who rules men and
things by His arbitrary will and who answers prayers,
and that there is no heaven of everlasting bliss to
which we are to be wafted after death. And I maintain
this not only because I think that these religious
beliefs are erroneous, but because I know that they
are most potent to make men docile and submissive
to the most degrading conditions imposed on them. I
feel sure that the doctrine that obedience to rulers and
contentment in poverty are according to the will of
God, and the doctrine that the poor and the oppressed
will be compensated in heaven are the chief causes of
slums, prisons, lunatic asylums and poor-houses.</p>

<p>All political tyranny is backed up and made possible
by belief in an arbitrary God, and all poverty is endured
because of the belief that after death everlasting
happiness and wealth await us. Two conditions are
necessary to human happiness: personal freedom and
general wealth. But we never can be free as long as
we believe that it is the will of an infinite heavenly
ruler that we should submit to a finite earthly ruler,
whether he gets upon the throne by hereditary succession
or by the votes of a majority; and wealth will
never be justly, and therefore, generally, distributed
as long as most of the people believe that because
they are poor in this world they will be rich in the
world to come.</p>

<p>The apostle Paul says that political rulers are ordained
by God and must be obeyed, from the King
to the constable, from the President to the policeman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
He says that if you are refractory, "the minister of
God" will use his sword, and will not use it "in vain."
He says that the sword-bearer is God's minister.</p>

<p>Christ himself recites a parable about a rich man
who went to hell because he was rich and a poor man
who went to heaven because he was poor. Rich
Christians are told by the clergy that the surest way
for them to get to heaven is by being rich; but they
use this parable to console the poor with the idea that
the surest way for them to get to heaven is by being
poor. And this idea is confirmed by the saying of
Christ: 'Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.'</p>

<p>I claim that it is impossible to prove that any being
exists who can do, or ever does, anything outside of
the regular processes of Nature, and therefore that
the word "God," which has always meant such a
being, should be dropped. I would have no objection
to the current use of the word "God" if that use were
harmless, but it is very far from that. It is a word
that every despot conjures with to keep the people in
ignorance and subjection. It is a word that crafty
politicians use in carrying out their schemes of bribery
and plunder.</p>

<p>The same thing applies to the word "heaven." It
is impossible to show that there is any such place,
and the word is used as a bribe to the poor to keep
them quiet under injustice. I do not see how there
can be a life after death, but if there is it will not be
any better because we are poor and undeveloped in
this world, and therefore immortality should be a
reason rather for discontentment among the poor than
for submission to injustice.</p>

<p>As an atheist, I object to a God who is for every
tyrannical ruler and against the rebels that he imprisons,
tortures and slays; who is for the idle landlord
and usurer and against the workers; who is for
the purse-proud prelate and against the people; who
is for the boodle politician and against the happiness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of the many; who is for the white exploiter and
against the simple colored man; who is for the rich
profiteer and against the petty burglar and pickpocket.</p>

<p>If I am told there is no such God as this, I reply
that there is, or there is none. The God of every
Christian creed is the God of the rulers, the God of the
idle rich. There never has been any other God known
to the world. This is the God that the church now
worships and always has worshiped.</p>

<p>There are forces in Nature that we do not yet understand,
and therefore should not name. But they
can only help us as we learn what they are and how
to use them. It is therefore neither our duty nor our
privilege to pray, nor can any good be thus achieved.
It is for us to observe, to think, and to examine the
pretensions of the privileged. It is for us to understand
that there is no God to raise our wages, and no
heaven to compensate us for our poverty and all the
misery it entails in this world.</p></div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>According to Marxian socialism, the history of man
arose from the need of his body for food, raiment and
shelter. This is the materialistic explanation of history,
and the following is one of the passages in which Marx
clearly shows that it is true and reasonable:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the social production which men carry on they
enter into definite relations that are indispensable and
independent of their will; these relations of production
correspond to a definite stage of development
of their material powers of production. The sum
total of these relations of production constitutes the
economic structure of society&mdash;the real foundations,
on which rise legal and political superstructures and
which correspond to definite forms of social consciousness.
The mode of production in material life
determines the general character of the social, political
and spiritual processes of life. It is not the consciousness
of men that determines their existence but, on
the contrary, their social existence determines their
consciousness. At a certain stage of their development,
the material forces of production in society
come in conflict with the existing relations of production,
or&mdash;what is but a legal expression for the
same thing&mdash;with the property relations within which
they had been at work before. From forms of development
of the forces of production these relations
turn into their fetters. Then comes the period of
social revolution.</p></div>

<p>Marx and his followers are justified in their contention
that the physical necessities of man (not gods or
great men) constitute the key to his history by the fact
that there was no mind of man before the human body
nor will there be any mind when the body has been disintegrated;
for the mind was made by the body, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
body, not the body by the mind, for the mind. This
very remarkable fact, when duly considered, will change
nearly all the ideas of most men and women about almost
everything.</p>

<p>A leader is but a mouthpiece of a people through
which they give expression to their deepest convictions
and highest aspirations. Early in my life Lincoln was
the great leader of the people in the United States, and
late in it Lenin is the great leader of the people of the
world. The earlier of these was at least a rationalist
and the latter is an atheist, so that the first probably did
not suppose himself to have been inspired by a divinity,
and the second certainly does not.</p>

<p>I claim, said Lincoln, not to have controlled events,
but confess plainly that events have controlled me.</p>

<p>In Lenin's Birthday Anniversary number of the magazine,
Soviet Russia, the Editor says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At the very outset, we must clearly state that much
of Lenin's powerful position in present-day history is
made by the history itself,&mdash;by the fact that we are
living at the moment when the entire life of the race
is vindicating in a most emphatic manner the
theoretical position occupied by Lenin for many years.
After all, Lenin, like Trotsky, was an unknown man,
except to certain political circles, and the mass of
Russian revolutionists, even as late as 1916. And yet,
he was the same Lenin; had not the opportunity
come to put into practice the system for which he
and his associates had been laboring and suffering for
many years, no doubt the circle of his admirers and
readers would not be much wider in 1920 than it was
in 1916. Lenin would probably be the first to admit&mdash;nay,
insist&mdash;that the material circumstance that enables
a certain individual to assert himself is the
prime element in building his reputation. So that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
if the Russian Revolution had not taken the course it
did take, Lenin, with exactly the same mental and
idealogical preparation, might have remained a relatively
unknown man.</p></div>

<p>Those who on the one hand interpret life from the
naturalistic or materialistic point of view, and those who
on the other hand interpret it from the supernaturalistic
viewpoint need not and generally do not differ as
widely as is commonly supposed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Materialism is the name for two totally different
things, which are constantly confused. There is, in
the first place, materialism as a theory of the universe&mdash;the
theory that matter is the source and the substance
of all things. That is (if you associate "force"
or "energy" or "motion" with your "matter," as every
materialist does) a perfectly arguable theory. It has
not the remotest connection with the amount of wine
a man drinks or the integrity of his life.</p>

<p>But we also give the name of materialism to a certain
disposition of the sentiments, which few of us
admire, and which would kill the root of progress if
it became general. It is the disposition to despise
ideals and higher thought, to confine one's desires to
selfish and sensual pleasure and material advancement.
There is no connection between this
materialism of the heart and that of the head.</p>

<p>For whole centuries of Christian history whole
nations believed abundantly in spirits without it having
the least influence on their morals; and, on the
other hand, materialists like Ludwig Buchner, or
Vogt, or Moleschott, were idealists (in the moral
sense) of the highest order. Look around you and
see whether the belief or non-belief (for the Agnostic
is in the same predicament here) in spirit is a dividing-line
in conduct. There is no ground in fact for
the confusion, and it has wrought infinite mischief.&mdash;McCabe.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>As to their philosophy concerning the origin, sustenance
and governance of the universe, communists are
almost to a man materialists; but, as to their philosophy
concerning life, they are as generally idealists. There
is, I feel sure, as much idealism in my thinking and
living now as there was in the days of my orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Many of the representations of the Jewish-Christian
Bible are materialistic in a high, if not gross, degree.
This is true of the account of the creation according to
which the god, Jehovah, with hands moulded a man out
of dust; performed a surgical operation upon him for
the purpose of securing a rib out of which he carved a
woman; made a garden; and provided worship for
himself by a system of material sacrifices. The ark of
the covenant was a wooden chest, and its contents (a
pot, some manna, and Aaron's rod) were materialities.</p>

<p>The conception, birth, death, descension, resurrection,
ascension and session of the god, Jesus, were (if they
occurred) material realities. And the eating of the flesh
and drinking of the blood of the god sounds like materialism,
especially according to the explanation of the
Greek, Roman, Lutheran and Anglican churches.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>A nutshell summary of this booklet is contained in
these confessions of my religious and political faith:</p>

<p>I. My religious faith is summed up in the following
creed of twelve Articles:</p>

<p>(1) The chief end of every man should be to make
the most of his own life by having it as long and as
happy as possible and to help others in doing this for
themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Though parents live unconsciously in their children
and all do so in those over whom they have had
any influence, yet all there is of conscious, personal life
for man is of a terrestrial character, none celestial.</p>

<p>(3) Knowledge is the Christ of the World. The
saviour-gods of the supernaturalistic interpretations of
religion are symbols of this one.</p>

<p>(4) Ignorance is the devil of the world. The destroyer-gods
of the supernaturalistic interpretations of
religion are symbols of this one.</p>

<p>(5) Knowledge consists in knowing facts and truths.
Every real fact and truth is a word of the only gospel
which the world possesses.</p>

<p>(6) A fact is something which matter, force and motion
have unconsciously done, not what a god has consciously
willed. There are no other facts.</p>

<p>(7) A truth is a fact so interpreted that if it is
lived it will contribute towards making the most of
life. There are no other truths.</p>

<p>(8) Hence the greatest people in the world are the
scientists who discover facts, and the preachers who
interpret them and persuade to their living. If you
contend that mothers are greater than teachers, I shall
agree with you on condition that you will admit that a
mother is not really great unless she is a teacher.</p>

<p>(9) The desire and effort to learn facts, interpret and
live them constitute morality.</p>

<p>(10) Morality is the greatest thing in the world, because
it is all there is of real religion and politics.</p>

<p>(11) But, paradoxical as it may seem, there is one
thing which is greater than the greatest thing in the
world&mdash;freedom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>(12) And the freedom which is greater than morality
consists in the liberty to learn, interpret, live and
teach facts, without which liberty a man may be a non-moral
child, or an immoral hypocrite, but he cannot be
the possessor of the pearl of great price&mdash;morality,
without which human life is not worth the living or
even possible.</p>

<p>II. My political faith is summed up in the following
creed of twelve articles:</p>

<p>(1) As the universe in general is self-existing, self-sustaining
and self-governing, so man in particular, who
is but one among the transitory, cosmic phenomena,
has all of the potentialities of his own life within himself,
so that every man can say of himself what the
makers of Jesus had him say: I and my Father are
one.</p>

<p>(2) Man has set a far-off and high-up goal of an
ideal civilization for himself, and is finding the way to
it by his own discoveries, and is walking therein by his
own strength, so that he is not in the least indebted to
any of the gods of the supernaturalistic interpretations
of religion, either for the setting of the goal, or for
what progress he has made towards it.</p>

<p>(3) Nor is humanity indebted to its outstanding representatives
for the advance in the way of civilization,
as is evident from the fact that, but for the gods, it
would have long since been far beyond the point where
the English-German war would have been within the
range of possibilities, and these gods are the gifts to a
blind humanity by its blind leaders.</p>

<p>(4) Humanity is not indebted to its physical scientists
any more than to its spiritual prophets for its advance
in the way of civilization, because the scientists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
have always worked, as the prophets have preached, in
the interests of the profiteers of the existing system of
economics. Economic systems have been the chief, if
not indeed, the only promoters of war, and the world
war with its tremendous horrors would not have been
possible but for science.</p>

<p>(5) So, then, the history of civilization has been
what it is because of the economic systems by which the
material necessities of life (foods, raiments and houses)
have been produced, not because gods have made
spiritual revelations, nor yet because men have made
great discoveries and persuasively taught them. According
to Marx, who discovered the key to the door of
history, it is constituted neither by the gods in the
skies, nor the great men on earth; but by economic systems.
These create the divinities and the leaders, not
they them.</p>

<p>(6) Thus far in the history of mankind every civilization
has rested upon the institution of slavery and
there have been, speaking broadly, three different forms
of it, with their correspondingly different civilizations,
chattel, feudal and capital. Each of these forms of
slavery has been the foundation for a superstructure of
a civilization peculiar to a distinct period of history.
Chattel, feudal and capital slaveries respectively constituted
the foundations for the superstructures of ancient,
mediaeval and modern civilizations. The second
of the two great discoveries by Marx was that the wage
slavery of capitalism, by far the worst of all slaveries, is
due to surplus profits.</p>

<p>(7) Since civilizations have their embodiments in
religious and political institutions (churches and states
with what goes with them) so clearly as to justify the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
contention that religion and politics are the halves of
one and the same reality&mdash;civilization&mdash;it follows that
I am right in carrying my materialism over from the
realm of religion into that of politics.</p>

<p>(8) A system of economics is about the most materialistic
thing in the world, yet it is the only key which
will open the door to the temple of human history. Having
opened it with this key, the first thing to be seen
is a world divided into two classes, one class whose representatives
live by owning the material means and the
machines for production and distribution; and another
class whose representatives live by working in making
and operating these machines, with the result of producing
and distributing the material commodities by which
the world is fed, clothed and housed, but to the surfeiting
of the owners who as such produce nothing and have
everything and the starving of the workers who produce
everything and have nothing.</p>

<p>(9) Capitalists and communists agree that when the
goal of humanity has been reached the world will find
itself to be one all inclusive co-operating family.</p>

<p>(10) Capitalists say that then the co-operating
will be between the owners as fathers, and the workers
as children. The capitalists will recognize every laborer
who does a fair day's work as a good son or daughter,
and the laborer will recognize every owner who gives a
fair day's wage as a good father.</p>

<p>(11) But communists say that then the co-operating
will be between men, all of whom are on the same footing
as laborers, since, when the goal is reached, the
world will no longer be divided as it has been, from
time out of mind, into a small owning or master class
and a large working or slave class; but it will consti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>tute
one great all inclusive family, every member of
which will be on the same footing with all others, except
that the older members will regard the younger
as sons and daughters, and they in turn will be regarded
as fathers and mothers, and all of the same
generation will look upon each other as brothers and
sisters.</p>

<p>(12) Civilization always has been and ever will be
impossible without slavery, because leisure and opportunity
for study, social intercourse and travel are necessary
to it, but under capitalism, as it works out, only
representatives of the owning or master class have these
prerequisites, and those of the working or slave class
must be deprived of them. When communism supplants
capitalism all will have their equal parts in both the
labor necessary to the sustenance of the physical (body)
life, and also the leisure necessary to the development of
the psychical (soul) life. There will still be slavery,
indeed much more of it than the world has hitherto
known, but machines, not men, women and children will
be the slaves. Of course there will remain much work
connected with the making and operating of the machines,
but the time and energy required for it will more
and more decrease with the inevitable increase in the
number and efficiency of the machines until, according
to conservative estimates, three or four hours per day of
comparatively light and pleasant employment will be
quite sufficient to provide the necessities of life in
abundance for every worker and his dependents, so that,
then, all will have as much of them as the few have
now; and this without any sense of slavery because
when one is working for the benefit of himself and his
own in particular, and the public to which he belongs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in general, not for the profit of a class of which he is
not a representative, there is no feeling of irksome servitude.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>A world-wide revolution has begun and is rapidly
spreading over the earth. Why? Because a world-wide
economic system for feeding, clothing and housing the
people has broken down so that it must be supplanted
by a new system, else mankind will perish for the lack
of food, raiment and shelter.</p>

<p>This revolutionary war is between the working class
whose representatives live starvingly, though they produce
and distribute all the necessities of life and the
capitalist class whose representatives live surfeitingly,
though taking no part in the production and distribution
of these necessities.</p>

<p>Nearly one hundred years ago our fourth President,
James Madison, saw partly and dimly what nearly every
one now sees fully and clearly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We are free today substantially, but the day will
come when our Republic will be an impossibility. It
will be an impossibility because wealth will be concentrated
in the hands of a few. A republic cannot
stand upon bayonets, and when that day comes, when
the wealth of the nation will be in the hands of a
few, then we must rely upon the wisdom of the best
elements in the country to readjust the laws of the
nation to the changed conditions.</p></div>

<p>The laborers of Russia have turned the country right
side up so that they themselves are above and the capitalists
below, having the privilege of remaining down to idle
and starve or else to crawl up to work and live, but not
to rob, war and enslave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>As I lay down my pen the working man's government
of Russia is fighting a double war, the Poland-Crimea
war, to prevent its overthrow by the capitalist governments
of the world, especially England, France, Japan
and the United States, which in this war are surreptitiously
confederated against it, and the victory seems
assured to it, largely because of the sympathy and help
of their fellow workers throughout the world.</p>

<p>Marx though dead yet speaketh. He is speaking
more widely and persuasively in death than in life.
Russia is the megaphone from which his voice goes out
through every land and over every sea.</p>

<p>Never man nor god spake with as much power as he
speaks. His gospel is to the slave, and this is its thrilling
appeal&mdash;workers of the world unite, and this is its
inspiring assurance&mdash;you have nothing to lose but your
chains and a world to gain.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
